Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about how to sell a business and if you're wondering who is this dude in his mama's basement's closet wearing a wife beater have anything to do with talking about how to sell business how does he even have the right the audacity to talk about these things let me first make a quick intro i've sold eight businesses my name's alex ramsey i own acquisition.
(00:19) com which is a portfolio of companies that does over 100 million dollars a year make these videos because i was once broke and wore these beaters out of necessity rather than out of choice and was in my mama's basement out of necessity rather actually i'm not in her basement this is a 5 million condo in vegas but that's not the point i just like working in places that have no windows so i have sold eight businesses over my career just to name a few of them i sold allen uh which is a software company that did 12 million in trailing
(00:43) 12-month sales i cannot disclose the price that i sold to but that was the top-line revenue the nda is actually fairly common in uh in sales agreements especially of an appreciable amount of money and the reason for that is because they don't want a potential new acquirer in terms of if you were to roll in other companies after they buy your company to know what you got for yours because then it hurts their negotiating power now that being said the next two companies that i sold in 2021 i sold for 46.2
(01:07) million dollars and i was able to do that because i negotiated that in because i was tired of not being able to talk to the other one and so there's the press release from that on top of that you might be like well i don't have businesses that big that's okay fear not i also sold five brick and mortar locations prior to this um and so i've sold actually that's seven i don't know why i said eight i shut down one there's the there's the other one there you go there's eight i had five brick mortar locations that i sold and here's what's even cooler i've actually sold those businesses to six different types of buyers i sold to financial buyers so
(01:33) private equity i sold two and family offices that's what fos so private equity or family offices which is all forms of private equity but institutional buyers or family offices second i bought i sold to strategic buyers uh which is the one who bought my software company i sold to friends i've sold to competitors i've sold to customers and i've sold to partners all right so i've done a lot of these deals and interestingly enough as it was going on i never thought wow this is someday going to come in handy and that i can help other people go through this as well because i've gone through all these kind of weird scenarios all right and so
(02:02) i've learned a lot in the process and i would like to make this because i get questions all the time about valuing companies and buying companies and we have companies that reach out to us so for acquisition.com we work with specifically service-based companies especially internet uh service-based businesses guru businesses e-learning businesses course business etc we purchase minority stakes in those companies to help grow them which is what the portfolio does now which is why it does over 100 million that being said we're very familiar with this process
(02:26) and so i wanted to walk you through this because a lot of people have questions about it and so i'll walk you through the overarching process and then i'll dive into each of them in more detail sound good awesome so phase zero zero is the pre-requisites these are the things that must be done or even even are required for you to be able to sell or have any kind of enterprise value to begin with which i'm gonna be really real with you most companies most businesses are not valuable at all all right most of them are just assets you might have equipment uh you know if you're a physical presence and if you're an online business you have very little
(02:54) value unless you have a lot of these things in place all right so most people want to try and go in business sell their business and find out that no one actually wants to buy it because people are not stupid all right so next is once you have these prerequisites which i'll go over you have to find a bank or a broker all right and this is something that i've gone back and forth on i sold some of them without i've sold some of them with i'll go pros and cons and i'll explain to you kind of how to negotiate that process and figure it out after that now we can actually start the
(03:16) selling process we have a bank we have somebody representing us to help us go sell our stuff all right and so this is the prep this is phase one all right phase two is now that we have prepared all the stuff now we go market the thing so that we can sell the thing to somebody all right phase three is now that we have people who wanna buy the thing now we gotta close the deal all right and so i'll walk you through each of the intricacies of these and there are honestly a lot of steps in this process if you want to have a big number money in the millions uh for a deal all
(03:41) right so let's start at the top all right prerequisites so these are deal killers these are things that make a deal not actually happen which i'll be wrote with you is the vast majority of the time most companies are just not that big and when i say this mind you i'm talking about institutional sized uh businesses so like if you wanna have a deal that's you know five million dollars plus which is about the smallest deal that any like real institutional investor private equity family office will will look at uh is there has to be
(04:06) you know a big enough size for it to make sense right now you you can have tons of people who do you know a lot of private investors and retail investors people who just have a little bit of money saved up then you know they might want to buy a dry cleaning business they want to drive by by a gym or they might want to buy whatever right like those are normal businesses but those aren't that's not what we're talking about here because those are all one-off and they're not going to make you rich all right and so that's why i'm focused on the how to make you rich type sale
(04:31) because these are much more uh difficult to understand and the process is a little bit more nuanced all right it took me a long time to learn this and guess what no one taught me this like i didn't see this anywhere and it took me a long long time took me a year to just kind of understand how the entire process worked to end in so that is what i'm trying to save you is a year of painstaking effort for me and i don't know who you are so i'm making this so that there you go all right so the biggest one though is that people are
(04:54) too small the next one is that there's a customer concentration meaning you have too few customers that equate to the business right if you have like 10 big customers if two of them leave or three of them leave all of a sudden you lose like a third of your business that is very risky all right people don't like that and so they will give you a massive discount on the value of business or not even be interested because it's too risky and especially if that's like those relationships are there because of you and they're they you know they like you and you're the kind of relationship manager which happens really commonly in
(05:17) small businesses next one is no defined sales process a lot of times people don't really have an acquisition process for getting new customers they don't know how they get customers they just kind of come their way and so if you don't have a repeatable or reliable way of acquiring customers ideally through multiple channels which i'll cover in a second you will probably not get a very good multiple or even want to get any kind of deal at all next is that when you when people do start this process a lot of the mistakes they make is they don't go through enough potential requires they're not trying to target of people they're like i talked to 10
(05:40) people and no one wanted to buy well no [ __ ] you talked to people got to talk to 500. right and that's how you can get somebody's going to give you the right kind of multiple on your business if you want to sell to an institutional investor next one's getting timing wrong so everybody always thinks that like man if i said another 18 months i cannot tell you the amount of times like it's almost like the the standard response of entrepreneurs is i'll be ready in 18 months because a year they know they're not ready but 18
(06:02) months for some reason feels like it's far enough out that they'll like somehow magically avoid their wand and all their problems will be done which is not true all right so uh getting the timing wrong is a huge issue and a lot of people sell too late very few people sell too early most people sell too late in my opinion uh and in so doing they can't sell at all and so the thing is is i heard this quote from the uh the managing partner of apg frasier preston really really bright guy he said this on one of our
(06:25) calls he said well business is always going to go up in value over time except when it doesn't and in case it becomes unsellable and so it was very very interesting to hear that because that is kind of the truth it's like either people see this thing as like oh wow this is a growing asset that's increasing in value and even if you stay the same for a period of time just more years under your belt makes it actually more reliable so it's less risky so literally the older a business gets even if it stays the same it becomes more
(06:48) valuable right that being said if you get the timing wrong as then it starts going down no one wants to catch a falling knife all right especially in private deals like this stocks and whatnot people are trying to time it it's a big enough company it's been around long enough et cetera that's different than small businesses which is what the vast majority of people who are watching this video have small business being defined as less than 100 i think employees next one you think it's worth more than it is and this is a big one right a lot of people are like man i
(07:11) heard that you know so and so got 20 times top line it's like yeah and that's because that's why it's newsworthy because it's weird right it's not common if there's a completed sale i think i just can't remember where i pulled this staff from the median number for uh m a deals for for this was uh for 5 million plus deals oh sorry camera what the media was shoot i think the median was five million dollars i can't i screw that the point is that the multiple was 6.
(07:37) 7 times trailing 12 months and that is for institutional buyers right now you might not have an institutional buyer which is why the vast majority of businesses that get sold get sold in private deals for like 1x 2x 3x and it's because they're not really reliable businesses for the most part they're just kind of asset sales like i'm handing you know a handful of employees over with some kind of working model and i'm just moving on to do other things which is honestly the vast majority of businesses that get sold it sold for almost nothing all right so we
(07:59) hear about the big wins but that's not the majority all right and so i want to be clear in that most businesses either don't get sold or get sold for very little money and so the point of this presentation is how to sell it for lots of money all right which you have to meet these requirements to even be considered okay uh the next next little doodad that we have on our list listicle here uh is not growing big enough tam or growth stores there's three different things i put in one bullets i needed to fit in one place all right so if the business isn't growing
(08:25) you're going to get a big discount on it now i said earlier that the longer business is in place uh the more valuables which is true but if you're not growing or you don't have like a ways of growing it or it means that like the strategy you're doing is no longer working people will see that as a risk so if you have even a tiny amount of decline people see it as a big red flag because then they'll extrapolate that into infinity on the flip side if you have a tiny amount of growth people do extrapolate that out further so like flip it around and sustain that growth
(08:47) for 12 months 18 months prior to the deal to get a much better number big enough tam so people might think oh this is uh this this business is cool it's a niche but it can't expand beyond this niche so you need to have a good growth story as in how are we going to really 10x this thing because people are buying not to buy your business they're buying your business for what they think the business will become all right that's what kind of private equity is all about no one's really trying to buy the thing they want to try to buy what things would it become all right and so that's
(09:12) when you make great deals right that's on their side so you have to tell them or explain to them the story of how it's going to work right and the the more they can believe that story that it's likely to occur then the more valuable your business will become next one and this is a huge one for small business is key man risk as in like are you the one who's the rainmaker you're the one who's bringing in you know all the deals are you the one who's you know the special man who does all the fulfillment all that kind of stuff like are people coming for you if they're coming for you
(09:34) then they're not going to come for your business which means that when you leave the business is worthless right and so you're a big risk and a lot of times uh this is i'll be frank with you in acquisition.com we work with companies that have key man and we work them over the next three to five years to help them not have keyman risk which is how we were able to exit gym launch which was started as kind of a more uh guru-esque business and then transformed into just a true uh business licensing business at an enterprise level and so
(10:00) there is a process of getting through that and you have to take the time to do it if you don't your business will not be valuable okay and then finally a single and there's more risks these are just some of the big ones uh single channel dependence meaning you only have one way of getting customers you have no other way and if tomorrow that shut off you'd be screwed people just imagine well if it shut off then i would lose my money and good investors don't take risks like that they don't want to go to zero and so that will massively impact the value of your business all right so
(10:23) these are deal killers these are things that get you to not sell or sell for very very little money and so you must check off these boxes before you can get big institutional money all right so this is the big bottom line of that section which is enterprise value is a discount applied to future sales to future sales which means you have to take the total amount of sales that a business takes between now and the end of time and then you apply a discount to it which basically means risk what's the likelihood that that occurs all right and so if you can show that you have a
(10:49) lot of future sales are going to happen and it's very very likely that they that they're going to occur then you'll have a very very valuable business if you have a small amount of future sales or a declining amount of sales then the likely that it happens is low and the amount is also low all right so that gives you low enterprise value so that's the bottom line that's what we want to show is going to show that we're going to make lots of sales and continue to grow and the likelihood of occurring is very very high they should be asking you why are you selling this business and
(11:11) you need to have a good reason for it so checked off that box let's go to phase two let's say you check all those boxes and you're like okay i think i have all those things i now want to find a banker or broker right and quick difference here bankers are what you're gonna need to sell to an institutional for the most part brokers are usually when you're selling for less than five million you get a broker and they have different fee structures because the amounts are lower and they have to do more deals all
(11:34) that kind of stuff all right and to be fair i think sometimes bro being a broker is even harder because you're selling [ __ ] let's be real okay so uh the way that i did this and so i'm just being real like the way that i did this is that i network for intros it's very hard i think you can try it uh go you know google investment banks google top whatever investment banks and esp specifically you'd want them in your market and your size so there's two components it's you know do they have they sold supplement businesses have they sold e-commerce
(12:00) businesses have they sold software businesses have they sold elearning businesses have they sold whatever type of business you have number one and number two have they sold them of your size right if someone you know has sold lots of e-commerce but they've only done deals that are like 500 million and up and you're doing like 10 million topline you're not going to be a fit for them because the buyers that they already know are not going to want to buy your thing because the check is too small all right and so these guys write a proportion like checks
(12:23) proportional to the fund size that they have of the capital right like if you have a billion dollars you're not gonna make a thousand dollar investment it just doesn't make sense at the time investment makes no sense all right so i use my network which means i just called everybody i possibly knew and said hey do you know anybody who knows anything about this and so you can start with entrepreneurs you can start with people you can start with your actual bank where you go like actually to do banking and you just pull threads and this is
(12:47) what took me a long time which is why i make this video to hopefully save you guys some time is that like networking to try and find these introductions was a pain i didn't i don't know anybody you know i mean like i wasn't born into an investment bank so i have no clue and so you network for introductions to these banks okay once you have that that uh some introductions right you then give them a one-page summary document you send them because they'll be like okay well send me send me a a a a teaser right it's like a sizzle sizzle page of like all the sexy things about your business the assets your lists how
(13:16) you you know it's just literally a one-page summary that should look really sexy that someone can look at and be like i would like to take another call with these people that's it that's the objectives just to get them to say yes i'll take a call with you once they say yes i'd like to take a call with you you then basically sell them on selling your business all right so you sell them on selling your business and then if they do like that they will usually fly out to you and meet with you in person with a team and then they will sell you on why they should sell your business and so the process here goes like you network for
(13:45) as many introductions as you can to bankers who are relevant to your size and your space you send them the one page teaser so that you can get them uh interested they then a certain percentage of those will take a phone call of the phone call you sell those people and why it's a good deal they will then follow up with you and say yes i think it's a good deal let's talk let's talk in person you'll then probably meet with you know four to six bankers um to tell you why they think they would be the best ones to represent you and get you the highest enterprise
(14:09) value and that's where you're going to negotiate their fee structure and you're going to be asking them questions around what other deals like yours they have sold and what their network looks like now they're all going to say they know all the people and all the decision makers and all the things right but the real thing you want is people who have sold businesses similar to yours in terms of market and size in recent history all right because that means that they are it's recent they're in the know it's not like they sold something three years ago that was similar because
(14:32) they're way out of way out of touch all right you want people who do this type of deal all the time now the typical fee structures what else what to watch out for so the their fees and agreements they usually have an upfront amount sometimes that's all these things are negotiable you can negotiate that out you can go shade it in they usually ask for upfront if they if the number is lower so if they don't think that it's likely that they're going to sell they'll ask for an upfront which you can use at a negotiating point which is like you
(14:54) don't think you can sell it because then it gives you a point to argue back to somebody else right they'll give you targets uh for what they think they could sell for and then they will give you ratchets which is like and if we sell for over x we get x percent we sell for over y we get z percent what bankers will actually do is once they will help you package the business and they will go out to market and they will pound the pavement and they will talk to hundreds of buyers and they will walk you through this process but it's good to have an understanding of this process by and
(15:19) large so that you cannot sound like an income poop when you're talking to them all right there's usually also a breakup fee which you can negotiate out of the deal or at least decrease it and you can also on the flip side have minimums which is like if you guys don't sell me if you don't get an offer above x then you don't get paid at all right and so we had minimums in our deals so that they wouldn't actually get paid so they're super incentivized so the things that like you really want to uh be cognizant
(15:43) of uh is is the minimums and especially how they're gonna get paid like what number they're getting paid off are they getting paid off the total enterprise value or they're gonna get paid off the cash you receive right and you wanna negotiate off the pass you receive not the enterprise value because let's say you sell 10 of the company for a billion dollars i'm saying for you know silly math so you'd get 100 million bucks if let's say they got four percent of enterprise value right they would get 40 million of the 100 million all right so there's little things like this that they will use to [ __ ] you all right so like be cognizant of these things and
(16:11) the targets and the ratchets that they put in place it sounds like it's um you want them to be really excited to push it but the things that i really would want you to pay attention to are gonna be the minimums and what they're getting paid off of and breakup fees and upfronts all right because at the end of the day you know the ratchets and targets hopefully you're happy with this on the front end because what happens sometimes is the reverse which is people all of a sudden start hearing the lois and whatnot and start getting greedy um and i don't think that's why it's like decide write down a number before you
(16:37) start the process and talking to all these guys because they'll blow your mind up and they'll tell you that you're gonna sell for a billion dollars and then you sell for not a billion dollars okay for much less less than that so write down the number write it to a letter to yourself and say i would accept this for this reasons all right because this is one of the most emotional processes you can possibly go through it's selling a part of yourself selling part of your identity and so you can get tied up in it okay now you will sell your company better than almost any banker all right so they're
(17:01) going to be experts in the process you will be the one who's going to be an expert at selling your company especially if you're a promotional entrepreneur you know how to sell right and so you want to be very instrumental in giving them the selling story because they're going to be the ones who are doing the selling but you're also going to be doing selling as well so you need to be giving them the salient points you think that they're they're going to say that they're experts at this they're not that like even though they've sold a handful
(17:23) of companies they've only sold a handful right they just sold five like yours that's still a ton just like yours but you want to have the really selling points that only you will know because they don't know your business right you got to give them the really sexy stuff right and as a reminder these people are like real estate agents they're trying to sell both sides they're trying to get a deal done more than the best deal even though they have ratchets even though they have these things the big thing they're trying not to do is not close a deal and so they will do everything they
(17:46) can to get both sides to just meet in the middle and sell but that's not necessarily in your best interest okay so just remind you here it's not in necessarily your best interest all right now this was the false belief that i had which is they will know what they're doing and we'll get you the best deal which is not true which i just explained this and so this is the negotiating point this is a writer downer for you they only responded and i had to learn this the hard way to if i don't get this point the deal is off
(18:12) otherwise they basically just steamroll you and you might say like well maybe you had bad banking experience who knows but i'll just tell you this is my experience is that you have to be willing to walk away from the table in order to get the best deal all right which is why you win negotiations before you start them by having options all right you want to have an amazing business you want to have a business you don't want to sell that's the best way to sell a business is to not want to sell it right and you have to get there
(18:36) if you're like i would just get rid of this thing for nothing then prepare be prepared to get rid of this thing for nothing because it's because it's going to get there because they're going to drill you because these are professional negotiators on the other side table that's what they do all day long you might have sold your business one time they buy businesses every [ __ ] day all right so they know exactly how you feel they know exactly how to manipulate your emotions to get you to say yes to
(18:53) lowest price okay so what you want to say here is that if i don't get this the deal is off and it took me a really long time to learn this and then all of a sudden when i started speaking this language the beggar started responding to me like oh no this is really a big deal for them like if they don't get this then all of a sudden they start negotiating for me because what will happen in this world of institutional is they just say no to everything unless you say you're going to walk then they're like okay fine we'll give you that one right so they
(19:16) will just say this is our deal structure unless you take it or leave it unless you say i'm willing to walk on these points all right and then they will start moving just my observation now i'm telling you i'm sharing this stuff because no one share this with me all right so uh we covered finding the banker uh how to negotiate the fees uh what to look at in terms of how to interface with them to negotiate on your behalf now let's start the actual process all right so there's the prep and this is a big big picture of what the what this whole process looks like
(19:41) once you've got audited financials once you've got a sim which is a um shoot i don't even know it's something model i think but basically it's like this hundred page plus thing of really in depth of the financials and the story and the competitive analysis and the marketplace and the growth trajectory and all the stuff that's what they should be doing for you all right they should make that thing um and they will send the the teaser out to all the you know 500 people of those people a certain percentage will sign ndas which is non-disclosure agreements because then
(20:10) because it's anonymous they won't they won't when you're sending out the teaser it doesn't disclose what the company is that way you know employees and things like that don't get scared by you just shopping the company all right so this is how i recommend doing so you have 500 buyers contacted and you'd want to ask these questions how many buyers are you contacting how big is your list what are what are your potential requires right 98 uh ndas from there you'll usually get like 14 or so is 15 right uh from there about half of those uh you'll do kind of like management
(20:38) presentations from there you'll get two to four lois and io is the indication of interest which is non-binding and loi is also typically non-binding um but it's a letter of of interest which is like this is what we're prepared to pay for the business from there you negotiate them against each other and then you get one deal right and then you you sign the loi and then you go through the diligence process and then you close okay that is how these sales numbers break down if you've talked to 10 people then lo and
(21:03) behold you probably are not going to get a good number right and so that's how this process works the thing is a lot of these guys are lazy so you have to push them on these numbers to send out more like repeat follow up with these people and i'll be honest with you on the deal that we ended up doing it wasn't uh the first set of buyers that we got to the table it was actually somebody that my cfo pushed our bankers to follow back up with again that ended up being the the final acquirers all right so like you
(21:26) want to push them because at the end of the day they're going to try and do as little as possible to get paid i'm just being real with you that's the real world all right so let's do it so now that we have to understand how the sales process works this is now you're working with the bankers you got to get this prep stuff done so you got to get your due diligence in you got to get organized a lot of people don't have this stuff draft of the sim there it is confidential information memorandum all right so you got to complete that get a review that's a huge amount of work all right uh and these weeks are just rough
(21:50) all right these are rough amount of weeks all right i'm going to show you 20 weeks in this presentation but like that whole pre-process of getting the bankers took another like three months so i would say roughly from the time you start this process the time you get a check in your bank account is usually 12 to 18 months all right i'll say 12 is a nice like if you're like if today you decided you wanted to buy it would take a year before that actually you'd have a check in your bank account all right so then they're going to put together the list of potential buyers or investors
(22:18) then they're going to have the summary fact sheet and the confidentially the nda is agreed upon and then that's it that's the prep phase all right that's it simple simple all right now we start marketing because we got all the materials done now we market them okay so now we contact those perspective virus we go neat uh teaser then nda then which is the one to three page blind description of the business then the data room which is basically like they have to put the stuff like in the cloud so that people can always have access to it so all these potential buyers will be sifting through all your your resources
(22:49) to come up with questions that they're gonna ask you or say that's not a good deal for them right this is when you have your kind of your pitch deck right of what you're going to present to them right you're going to dry run practice it etc potential investors will then submit their ios all right that's the indication of interest that they're like we might be interested in buying this business and they'd give a rough range right and then you have potential people who are i'm trying to go through this part faster because it sounds boring but this is the stuff this is how it works right so potential investors visit company they
(23:19) provide you provide access to the data room of all the diligent stuff that they're gonna need so they have a cursory idea of what they need and you do the data room so you don't have to do all this interaction just put all the [ __ ] up there and they can all have access to it and then when you start on the the actual uh offers which is here week 18 final offers received and evaluated strategy is determined for moving forward with final parties right so this is where you bid them back against each other and then you get final offers which is lois okay letters
(23:43) of intent okay now once you have the letters of intent and you bid them back together you're gonna have different deal structures are to be presented to you which i think is covered here okay so you start negotiating those you go back and forth et cetera now here's the thing there's the price and then how it's paid it's price and terms and i can't tell you like getting good terms is worth discounts right now it depends on what you're selling if you just want to sell to have a story and that's one thing but if you're starting to get rich then the terms matter a lot all right so people
(24:11) share a big number like for example if i wanted to say i sold you know gym launch prestige ops for a hundred million dollars i could have gotten 100 million dollars in paper all right so hear me out so if i said hey pay me 25 million earn out if we do a billion dollars this year in sales sure they'll sign it and then i could say that added 25 million to my enterprise value on the sale i will be transparent with you i had no seller financing i had no earn out i had no i did do i did real equity because i sold uh 66 and i had no transition services and no
(24:41) consulting all right and that was because that was the that was the agreed upon way that i wanted to sell this business and i said that upfront to everybody i said this is a full uh leadership exit i will not be involved i will not have a transition because the thing is if they're like sure if you just keep working for the business for two years yeah we're fine selling too it's like well i might as well own the damn thing right and i'll just grow it myself right and so this is where this is important now mind you
(25:04) acquisition.com for example for our business we only do minority investments because we want the leadership team there so we actually want to just participate in the growth and help grow the companies from 3 million to 10 million to 20 million to 50 million and beyond right we want to participate in the growth and we're happy taking a smaller life of what we consider to be a bigger pie rather than ripping out the management right so we're we work with people who are like not not really ready for institutional yet but want to get
(25:27) that 20 million dollar 50 million 100 million dollar plus exit i'm going to get them ready just for context all right so these are the things that will discount you so if you had 100 million dollars for example for an exit they might say okay well we're going to put 25 million in earn out 25 million is gonna be seller financed you're gonna roll 20 which is 20 million so there's 30 million dollars left uh and so we'll give you 30 million dollars in cash uh and you say oh i sold my company 100 million right and then of the 30 you've got the bonuses and you've got other
(25:54) equity you know partners if you have those and then you've got the tax man so all of a sudden let's say you've got 20 that's given to your team so now you're at 24 million and then taxman takes his 30 right uh and you've got closing fees and things like that and escrow fees uh and so now you're at uh whatever 18 17 million so you sold your business for a hundred million dollars we only got 17 million bucks right that's why this stuff matters okay so you want to make sure that you know why you are selling and what the most important things are for you and you need to ruthlessly ruthlessly
(26:26) communicate that to the bankers okay very important point because they will negotiate on those points for you now the things that they're also looking for for them is is it's a fit within their portfolio like a family office for example is just going to buy something that they think is a good cash flow investment and the price is going to be very important to them a strategic buyer would be somebody who's going to be let's say let's say you own a car wash you know chain or whatever if there's a bigger car wash chain that just wants to buy yours they'll give you a better multiple because they already have all these systems in
(26:54) place so they're going to make more money from your business than just a generic buyer will so the ideal way to exit is too strategic because you'll get the best multiples but to be fair there are more financial buyers than their strategic so that's kind of the trade-off okay and you want to make sure that that your business is in good hands so that you want people who have relevant experience we were very fortunate that the people that we felt were most equipped to buy the company were also the ones who ended up giving us the best offer and so
(27:17) that's that doesn't happen we were very fortunate end up working out that way for us um but this this it doesn't always happen that way and then this is a really simple one do i like these people will my team like these people because ultimately the team's gonna be working with them right so you want to ask those questions as you're going throughout all right so like you can have [ __ ] who pay a little bit more and then really nice guys who pay a little bit less life's short man so like i would go with people who a lot of people regret just taking the
(27:40) highest offer rather than 10 less and having a much better life okay at this point you would sign your loi all right most of the times it's going to be exclusive saying like if you have a tremendous amount of interest you might be able to sign lois and have them not be exclusive and they still bid all the way up to the purchase agreement most times that's not the case they don't want to they don't want to expend the money so like the so apg when they bought us spend probably about a million bucks in diligence just in
(28:04) diligence right to figure out whether our company is worth buying right and again you're not going to attract guys who are going to write 100 million you know do a million dollars in diligence for a 5 million deal it makes no sense right so like if you want big money numbers you have to you got to follow the big money process all right so at this point you signed an exclusive loy meaning you can't shop the business to anybody else during the period of the of the due diligence now i'm gonna say at the end but i'm gonna say it again all right and i've got a special treat for you which i'm now remembering uh at the end of this video
(28:33) i'll actually i videotaped us actually having the the escrow hit and the final signing and you can actually see it go down for real all right it's very anticlimactic but you can see it for real and now see what a 50 million cell looks like okay so the due diligence will begin they're going to try and negotiate time saying like oh we can get a faster close if blah blah blah if you accept this lower price [ __ ] they're going to take as long as they want literally ignore it they seriously they will try and use speed i had every single person try to use speed as a selling point i thought
(29:01) it was legit the first time they said 30 day close and it took sorry they said four i said 30 day close and it took 112 days and i i accepted worth this is on one of the other companies we sold i expected worse terms on that right so the next time i came around this is why i'm giving you this stuff next time i came around they were like oh we could do a fast because i was like whatever take your time my company's grown do whatever you want right and when you do it that way you're in the position of power okay
(29:24) so they're going to audit your quality of earnings which is something you have to get the bankers will explain how to do that which is to make sure that your numbers are legit that they are what you say they are right anybody can put numbers in excel sheet but are they for real right then they'll do legal diligence so they're going to make sure you actually own the company do you have any lawsuits against you are you in are you go are you breaking any laws which actually is fairly common when it comes to claims and things like that uh for like ftc
(29:46) things like like it's it's actually fairly common so you want to make sure that stuff's alright and that stuff can blow deals up i had a an acquaintance of mine that had uh two different deals blow up that were like nine figure deals multiple years apart because they were not compliant all right so like and they thought that the lack of compliance was one of the reasons that they were so successful and so they didn't want us too risky all right what they'll then do is they'll start interviewing your customers all right this may sound freaky but that's what they're going to do they're going to talk to your customers they're going to
(30:10) talk to your employees they're going to interview them the firm that purchases spent like 250 000 i'm pulling that number out of air but it's a lot on research uh to to see what the what your customers think about you so if you're terrified to think about what your customers who who are past customers who no longer pay you think about you be prepared right they're going to talk to them and be like should i buy this company is this a good company right what has your experience been like right and same thing uh with your employees
(30:32) now they're not going to ask them but the that stuff they're going to only talk to people already know about the deal but they're going to interview them really uh heavily to see what's your involvement is he really is he really passively involved like what do you do on a daily basis what do they do on the daily because they want to know that if you leave it's still going to keep going and growing all right then you've got background checks of you and your management team to make sure no one's you know a convicted criminal or something sketchy uh which more realistically is like financial fraud
(30:56) employment contracts to make sure that if you leave they don't all leave with you or they're like only there for you etc and you're like okay i feel like i'm done nope there's more okay so once you've gone through this whole dildos process which takes 60 to 90 days now if you're tracking with me there was like three months you know of looking for bankers and figuring that part out and making sure that your business is ready may take much longer than that but like assuming your business is ready right and you have met the prerequisites might
(31:18) take you 12 weeks to find the right bankers from there it's 20-ish weeks to get to this point and then you might have another 60 to 90 for diligence now bankers will say that it's gonna take less time they're incentivized to tell you that it takes less time so i was talking to a good friend of mine who was like hey man i got they said their 30-day diligence uh and it quick closed and i was like dude it's not gonna happen and it was for a nine figure number right and lo and behold 90 days later he was like
(31:43) yeah fast they said wrong they were right he's like why didn't you tell me this was gonna be so much fun right and he's now i think like five months into his process of post post agreement signed right so like i'm not saying that that's typical but i'm saying like you need to prepare it for a year like and it's going to be a year slog and a lot of your focus is going to go to this process so like you really need a strong management team a place who can continue to grow the business without you all right other and
(32:07) that'll prove the point and this is a note the longer the process takes it is in the buyer's advantage that take a long time all right so you want a fast close they want a slow close and being real the only way to speed up the close is to keep growing like crazy because they then they're going to realize that all of a sudden the valuation from the beginning to the end will have changed and then you will have much more negotiation power and you can break the agreement and get other offers right so important point there now so once you've
(32:36) gotten that point you'll get a purchase agreement inside of the purchase agreement you'll have these different pieces you have to watch out for indemnities are the things that you're reliable for these are the things that will keep you up at night you need to negotiate hard on these things now give the things that are reasonable like yes like fundamental you know individual warranties i think is the name of the clause whatever it's like you actually own the company you actually own the trademarks like yes you have to like yes otherwise the whole purchase is off right and you could be
(33:00) liable for the total purchase amount for that stuff right now that's the indemnities that the other indemnities are things that like are completely out of your control so you want to make sure you negotiate those things out and again with all these negotiations you have to be willing to walk away and say like i don't like if this bullet's in there the deal's off like and if you can't say that you're going to get raked over the calls okay now non-competes depends on why you're selling and what you want to
(33:21) do next but you want to be very specific and this is one of the hardest things that that you're going to get into negotiating especially if you have a skill if you're really good at you know trash compacting they're going to not want you to touch anything trash related for a long period of time all right and what's really tricky about this is that if you roll equity into the new company that they're going to be buying your your company in or whatever they will write in the articles of incorporation that none of the people who have that can compete and so even if
(33:46) you have a purchase non-compete you may have a non-compete as long as you are an equity holder in that other company which means that if you want to breach your non-compete you would have to give up the equity that you rolled in addition to uh the the the that's once the other non could be expired so you have to be very very careful about how these non-competes are written and the definitions that you have around this is so important like i can't tell like so for example if you were selling let's say a skincare line they might say they they they the first one you get might
(34:15) just say like you can't be in beauty anymore well that'd be freaking ridiculous right because you know the space and you're not competing with your company if instead of skincare you start getting into makeup right and you have to make that argument right it depends on the size of the deal and what you're willing like if this is the one deal that's going to seal all deals for you then maybe you'll be willing to give more right and be like all right i'm not going to touch the space for a long time right on the flip side if you're like i already know what my next thing is going to be and this is the best thing to do
(34:37) with the non-competes is know what you're going to do next because if you know what you're going to do next then you can be very specific with the language and you can make sure that you're 100 covered and just tell them that's what i plan on doing next i just want that to be affected and if you say that and i'm telling you guys the best way to negotiate these things is to be honest just tell them what you want and a lot of times it's much easier than trying to guess and ascribe blame and all that kind of stuff all right schedules is all the stuff that you provide it's basically another word of like proof right we're doing all this
(35:01) based on these assumptions and the assumptions have to be true for some reason the schedules are not there like we did this based on this you know customer segmentation analysis if you mentioned it in the selling process of getting them to say yes and negotiating but then you don't include it in the agreement as a schedule it's as though it didn't happen and then they can come back and screw you now this all sounds scary most of the times these agreements don't get repealed all right but you want to make sure that you include all the stuff and that stuff sucks but you got to do it you got to have a good lawyer for it all right definitions
(35:28) this is kind of interesting as a total philosophical point the agreement itself is is almost as long as the pages of definitions for the terms that are used in the agreement and i think socrates said wisdom begins with the definition of terms and so like fundamentally the agreement is like party a as defined by x agrees to pay y according to these terms two party z according to these terms according to the you know uh for this amount according you know whatever so it's like all these things are just terms that have to get defined and so
(35:59) i'll give you an example um a term that we were able to redefine i think it was actually i think we redefined a term within the non-compete that dramatically changed the the meaning of the document and made it much better for us to do whatever we wanted to do next and so like just changing the definition of a single word can run through an entire agreement and sometimes rather than fighting on clauses it's better to really narrow down the definition of what you're trying to define so the scope might be geography for non-compete or it might be
(36:28) like there's a million things that you define in these documents but making sure that you read the definitions for what these words mean is really important all right now the few points and this is just the points that you'll want to negotiate there's a zillion other things these are the main the big hitters networking capital since the very end you've already agreed on everything already agreed on the terms you already get in the price right now you have to grow networking capital which is how much money you're going to leave in the business right and this we're going to try they're going to
(36:50) try and get you there too right it's like hey let's say you've got a million bucks of working capital in the bank account they're gonna be like well you've had a million dollars sitting there for a whole year so that comes with the business you're like well i've just had it there because i didn't take dividends out of it which why by by the way is a good reason to dividend out stuff and keep you know little in the bank account if you're a smaller business now if you're reinvesting and buying and doing mma and stuff then that's a different question which most of you guys aren't doing that right now so that being said networking capital is
(37:13) what how much money uh is required to run this business so that when we have this transition it can continue to work as normal right and you want that to be as little as possible so that is so that you can take as much of that cash to the bank account in addition to what they're going to pay you all right and then finally is the escrow amount so let's say you've got that 100 million deal like i said earlier and they might say we want to keep 20 in escrow all of a sudden you've got 20 million in escrow and again we still have the escrow we've got the seller financing we've got the
(37:37) urn out we've got the splits that you have we've got taxes we've got we've got all these other things that are going to come out of it all right is you got to make sure it makes sense and so escrow amounts like if you can keep it under 10 you're rocking all right now they're going to probably keep some of it there and that's because they keep that as insurance like if something else comes up or there's some bill or blah blah that's your fault some back taxes whatever they take it out of the escrow amount all right that's how they do and then usually they will
(38:00) release that and again when they release it they can release it in phases so i think we had i think there was like a 90 day and then a one year for ours but like it can change some people have escrow that holds for two years some people don't have any escrow but it's a negotiating point all right and i'm repeating this don't let speed be a negotiating tool used against you all right it doesn't matter they're gonna take as long as they want so don't let them use that against you all right finally you've done all this stuff you've negotiated all the the hard points you've gotten here and it's now payday
(38:28) all right so first off it's very anticlimactic because it takes all this time and then all you do see is just like a big deposit in your bank account you're like oh well i guess i am the same so i'm just telling you that's what's gonna happen all right that being said you actually don't even sign papers there's so many papers that you actually have to pay someone to sign up because it takes so darn long so we actually paid our attorneys and i think it took like six hours just to sign on our behalf for all the documents and and do that for us all
(38:52) right now once all the documents are received by the escrow company both parties have signed everything at that point they initiate the deposits to the parties that have already been predefined so if you have payouts that go to let's say your bankers or brokers that comes off the top if you have payments that go to the escrow company comes off the top if you have distribution that come to your employees or other equity holders or investors that then all comes and then you get your piece all right and so uh to uh
(39:17) to and just hold on because i'll show you the actual video it's only like i think 30 or 40 seconds of the actual signing moment uh for us and you can see what it really looks like to close a 50 million deal but just a few closing thoughts on this is that they're going to treat you like you don't know anything all right and so you got to get smart you got to read stuff watch this video rewatch it and understand the pieces that someone's going to try and do to screw you over all right and you know a trust is gonna be a big component of this right so like you have to trust the people that you're gonna do business with and if you don't uh it's gonna be
(39:47) really difficult now that being said you can trust them but you still wanna verify right you still wanna make sure that the words say what they say they say and a lot of times that's not the case all right and so big picture if you do get to this point congratulations it's very very hard to to to grow a business do all the stuff and sell to an institutional buyer who will pay you know tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars for a company um these are just some of the lessons that i learned and this is the process it
(40:11) took me a long time to even just figure out how it worked um and for mozy nation i i make these videos because i no one told me this stuff and so i'm hoping that for you guys this helps you out and uh and hey if you're doing over three million you can hit us up and we'll see what we can do to help you out and help walk you through the process and just so you know this is the actual video of us giving the final word and seeing a 50 million deal go down in the real world between us and the lawyers and the private new firm so it's all there enjoy it and so
(40:41) if you could confirm that you release your signature pages contemporaneously with the release of the seller's signature pages we will be done on our side okay confirmed great um elizabeth yep we are we're good confirmed okay great and and alex can you can you confirm your release of signature pages um contemporaneously with the buyer signature pages such that we can close confirmed great well congratulations everybody um just in time for uh for a nice weekend hopefully uh i'll you know turn it over to frasier or alex if they want to say any words but um congratulations
(41:32) yeah alex is layla oh yeah yeah right here she's right excellent great okay good well guys congratulations it's a big milestone um we're happy to be here with you and um you know i know this has been like a long road and we're happy to be at the at the starting line here so are we we're excited for uh for the future and uh we have so many it's gonna be fun to announce it to the team on i think monday and tuesday so we're stoked it's gonna be a good it's gonna be a good next phase it's gonna be a good kickoff year for everyone yep anyways lots of love everybody see you
(42:13) in the next video keep being awesome bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to show you how to take an active business and make it into passive income so the goal that most of us entrepreneurs have right is to is to is to have freedom right so we want to not work or not have to work and have money coming towards us and the thing is is what i have learned is that you can make anything passive and you can make anything active and one of the difficulties for entrepreneurs when you switch from entrepreneur to investor is that you want to take your passive things and
(00:27) make them more active in order to increase your returns and that's a very tempting thing to do because we're entrepreneurial and we can see where the margin is getting lost right but if you always chase time then you'll always uh be able to make whatever it is like if you chase time always then eventually you'll end up with all your time and you should have some left over that is coming towards you right and so i'll give you a quick example gym launch uh two years ago i think mates it made 17 million i mean according to our quality
(00:52) of earnings we made 17 million in profit in uh 2019 2018 2018 excuse me 2018. and this year we'll probably do 8 million ish in profit so you're like whoa you cut in half here's the difference when we did 17 million i was the business it was 100 alex's face wrapped with a monetization structure wrapped around it i was taking calls i was doing all of these things i was definitely ceo i was definitely in front of the marketing i was also the product i was doing all those things right right now the business basically
(01:20) generates half the profit but it involves me for about 90 minutes a week and so my my dollars per hour are significantly higher because now i also have all these other things that i can do uh with the time that has earned back for me and so what i want to walk through in this video is kind of the the process and how to do it and when to do it and so one of the issues that i see people starting out and when i say starting out you know making a million three million etc is that i'll get messages from them and they're like dude i think i'm ready
(01:46) to outsource my business and i'm like but why like i don't think you've gotten to the i mean maybe maybe somebody who's at a zillion you know says to me like why are you doing that now but i think for me i would my answer would be like i've achieved the wealth that i that i want i don't need to to guess it anymore and now it's really using a different metric for success which is like how how much can i spend you know how much time can i spend with my life my wife how much time can i spend um whenever i want in the gym uh working
(02:10) out uh eating the stuff i want to eat et cetera right how can i have other metrics for success spending time you know meeting people etc and doing stuff like this which i never did while i was growing the business not in this way right and so anyways the the thing that i see people do is they try and jump out of the ceo seat too soon but what i want to do is give you the best model for how to do it when it's right right because ultimately if you can turn your active income into passive income i just love this quote you get paid on
(02:36) what you do you get returns on what you own right gym launch as an enterprise is far more valuable or my fitness companies because there's a couple there are far more valuable now than they were when it made 17 million dollars in profit because then no one would ever buy it right because no one's going to buy me right it's just a producer personality brand whereas now it is an enterprise that generates revenue by providing value to customers on a consistent basis and i have nothing to do with it and as a management team at
(02:59) place etc right and so as we make these transitions right going from ceo to owner you have to go from active to passive so this is the mental framework that uh that it took me a really long time to discover when figuring this out all right so think about your trajectory as an entrepreneur right so first you start you do everything right and then all of a sudden you start delegating out the things that are the lowest value time wise right if you can pay someone 10 an hour or 15 an hour to do you know 10 10 hours a
(03:27) week of your work then you get 10 hours back and then you can put higher value skills in those 10 hours and then make more money and then fundamentally that's literally what entrepreneurship is just arbitraging time over and over and over again and then leveling up your own skill sets so that with the time that you get back you can provide you can do more valuable things and that's i think one of the bigger issues that i see a lot too is that people will outsource their time and then not fill their time back up with
(03:48) higher value skills right now if that's what you want to do for lifestyles that's cool but like in terms of the game um if you if you seek to grow then you need to re re put more things in your stack and take the extra 10 hours and do something even more valuable maybe it's marketing again or learning a new channel or improving the product or whatever it is that's more valuable than maybe frontline support right or whatever and so the idea here is going from active to passive and so as i was saying when you replace
(04:13) that role right what you did is you got time back right and so if you do that enough times um you're always you know doing the next thing but here's what's kind of funny and this is the mental framework that i want to give to you imagine like let's say you look back at what you were doing a year ago and it probably should look different than what you're doing today right hopefully if you're if you're growing in your business what you're doing then versus what you're doing now is different and so if you look back to what you were
(04:39) doing then and you see the progress that you made to what you're doing now then rather than saying okay well in 12 months i'm going to be doing all these things and all these things are gone if you can actually jump two steps forward then your business could be 100 growing at the same pace it is now with somebody doing both of these things that you were doing and then you just owning it all right and i know you're like wait what does he mean i'll try and explain this again so this is like if you can understand
(05:04) this concept it will set you free and allow you to turn your active income businesses into passive income uh things that you get returns on these become assets that become sellable one of the number one issues that people have is like you can't sell personality brands you can't sell their own businesses because they're so integrally involved in them right and this is one of the mistakes a lot of people make especially smaller entrepreneurs is they're like you know my business makes let's say three million dollars a year right in in
(05:26) net profit well if if it would cost you know a million and a half to get all of the leadership and executives in order to do all the stuff that you're doing which is which is very realistic you might need four or five high level leaders to do that stuff then your business is actually making a million or a million and a half in profit so it's actually half as valuable so you're doing a million and a half dollars a year of payroll work because you're getting paid for that and then your business is returning you an
(05:52) extra one and a half million so your your total as a person are netting three million dollars but the business is generating 1.5 and you are generating 1.5 if you can delineate that concept it will serve you very well in business and especially with the concept i'm saying right now so the idea is what we want to do is take two steps forward from where we're at right now not one because if you take one step forward you delegate what you're doing now and then you start doing the next thing right that you need to do but if you
(06:17) delegate what you're doing now and then you get someone else to do the thing that you should be doing next then you can take a step back and now you're owning the business while this person now does the thing that you were doing before and that is ultimately how you can take your active thing and turn it into passive and now you're an owner who looks at the enterprise and then what's crazy about this is that you can actually see the weaknesses of your own business far better when you're outside of it looking in and see
(06:41) you can see the marketplace better you can see what your customers are saying better you just get so much more perspective and then you really become the chairman of the board and then you're really meeting with the ceo and you're you're talking to the ceo about their direct reports how they can improve as a leader and what they need to do um in order to kind of like and help them cast the vision for the company that's really it and the thing is the vision doesn't change that frequently and so you need to be smart about
(07:02) why you're choosing to go in the direction you are but once you've made the decision there's not a lot of change that has to happen right it's really like how can we execute consistently to get there and so big picture to wrap this puppy up if you want to go from business running to business ownership one don't do it too soon and this is the probably the number one mistake that i see people make is that they do it too soon two if you are going to do it then if you can think about what you get paid on versus what your returns on
(07:30) then you can separate what you do versus what you own within the value that you have in your own net worth like you are valuable because you have skills i i own that like i love this quote and i'll say it again poor people do the wrong things rich people do the right things wealthy people own the right things and so if you can think through that within your own life it's like well i need right now you're probably doing the right things and you own some of the right things right but you're doing both of these things you're getting paid here you're
(07:58) getting paid here and you're getting returns here so we want to put someone in place to do the things that we're getting paid for and then continue to keep the things that we're getting returns on now mind you at some point that means that you might lose half of your income if this if it's 50 50 right if if your business makes you a million dollars a year and then you make a million dollars you're working your business and the business nets you two million then you quitting right quitting and hiring somebody else to do this thing
(08:21) because you take two steps forward if you do that then all of a sudden you'll get a pay decrease but your dollars per hour will go up your enterprise value go up because now it is something that is sellable that operates without you all right and so that actually means that your net worth increases even though the the profit of the business decreases and then here's what's cool is that once you've done this right once you've eliminated the step and now you just own the thing that you get returns on now you can focus on how can i how can i
(08:47) increase revenue here trying to put more fingers on my on my revenue right how can i increase the revenue that i'm making here without me being involved because it's all about the constraints that we can put on ourselves so if i can increase the revenue without me doing anything how would i do that and then you ask better questions and then you get better answers and then that is ultimately how you can grow the wealth of the business without you spending more time or making more trade-offs that you don't want to make
(09:11) because you've got in this game for freedom right and so anyways hope this is valuable for you hit subscribe because it was check out the next video that comes up because i'm sure it's sweet and if you hated this uh then i would ask that uh you can you can also tell me that you hated it and um i will send you love either way so anyways keeping awesome let's look at you next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about how to structure the business in order to sell it and why you should do that independent of whether or not you're planning on selling it in the future so hi my name is alex mozi i have a portfolio companies that does just under 100 million a year in revenue we own three outright we have five that we have minority positions in and the reason i make this channel is because lots of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them if you have a business right now and
(00:22) you're trying to scale it you're trying to grow it there's usually one of two outcomes right either this is a is something that you're super passionate about um or this is an opportunity that you're passionate about because of the you know upside potential of making lots of money there's tons of people who really you know build software companies they're not like super passionate about like data management but they're really good at it and they think there's an opportunity to make money it doesn't really matter to me whatever way you do
(00:41) it is fine but what happens is over the trajectory of the careers of the entrepreneur you know we develop in skill sets we level level up you know first we're doing then we're managing that we're leading then we're casting the vision and you move your way up in the company as the company grows underneath of you as you scale right the thing is is that at some point you know i think the entrepreneurial journey is always trying to find the most leverage for our skills like what's the best vehicle for the skills that we have
(01:03) to capitalize on the opportunity marketplace right and that's the entire market not just within the context of your business but if you were building the company at some point and this i think one of the hardest transitions that i've had to go through and it took me a very long time to do this was transitioning from ceo to owner and you've heard me talk about this before but i'm gonna say it again because i think it's so important independent of whether i planned on keeping the businesses or selling the businesses learning how to structure the
(01:27) business so that it could sell someday was one of the most valuable things that i've done as an entrepreneur and i remember when i started out as like i'm never going to sell this company i'm never going to sell this company like i want to keep these things for life and that may or may not be true but as i've gotten older i will tell you this i do like having optionality and by structuring the company in such a way that i could sell it which i'm going to get to what's what some of those things are in a second it actually enabled me
(01:50) to have more freedom which was the ultimate goal of the business and so the biggest hardship that i've probably enforced on myself was starting another business while i had a business which is probably one of the questions i get most frequently from entrepreneurs was like well you say i should be focusing on stuff but you have all these businesses and the answer is yes and part of that is because i made mistakes and i'm hopefully hoping that you don't have to make the same ones that i did coming up which is i was ceo of one company and
(02:13) then started a second company because i wasn't doing anything in my first company or wasn't going to plan on doing anything in my second company i was like i can be ceo of both terrible mistake it cost me dearly um in time and stress and all the other things that go along with that but being ceo is a full-time role and so unless you are truly the owner of a company and not the ceo then that company still needs you and it means it's a not sellable or sellable for much less because it's still dependent on you as the owner and i
(02:41) remember i used to poo poo this when i was you know earlier on in starting my career i was like i would hear guru say like and maybe it's because i didn't know how to do it but they were like you know if a business can't run without you it's not a real business well i don't think it's not a real business i'd think that you are not an owner if it cannot run without you or you're an owner but you're also a ceo of the company and so for me understanding the difference between ceo and owner was really important because
(03:04) i didn't even have any examples of that right it was only when i started looking at the investor word the wealth world that i understand the difference between those two things and so as an easy example like if you look at warren buffett he doesn't run c's candy he owns these candies right he doesn't run geico he owns geico and he doesn't own you know ben bridges jewelers or whatever it is like he owns it he doesn't run it and so if you think about that within the context of you know your businesses is like is there a way
(03:31) that this business could not only maintain but also grow without my involvement whatsoever so that i could function the same way i do in the stock market as somebody who's in it who owns equity in this company that it grows without me now let me explain how my role works now because i have been able to structure my life so that i actually treat all portfolio companies the same so despite the fact that i have 100 ownership in three of them and i have you know minority stakes in the other five i still structure my engagements with them
(03:58) the same way so i'm still meeting quarterly with those those companies and their leadership teams and i have you know meetings as needed with them throughout and one of the important pieces is that i am nose-in hands out so you can write that one down like niho and i got that from a mentor of mine nose in hands out which means that when we have a meeting or we have a you know a long talk we want to talk about something strategic i don't walk away from the meeting with with with homework i don't walk away with to do's all right and that is a
(04:26) purposeful effort by design because if i had to walk with to do's from all these companies then i would i would never be able to get anything done right and so i go into there as a strategic advisor i'm there to offer my experience but i'm not there to lead the meeting i'm there to bounce ideas off of and the way to make that transition is that you have to build it with that intention so as i've now built businesses later in my career compared to earlier my career my earlier businesses i built independency on myself because i
(04:52) had those interpersonal needs and i also didn't know any better but hopefully if you're watching this you can know better and so this is one of the downsides of having a personality based brand compared to a business that's faceless that's really just a brand in and of itself that's outside of the entrepreneur or owner who started it right sees candies it's not about warren buffett geico is not about warren buffett they have a gecko right and that's the the mascot and so as i've transitioned through this i can tell you
(05:15) that now finally i would say i'm in a position where i actually am an owner and it's awesome it's great these companies pump out cash flow and i can allocate that cash flow accordingly and you know buy percentage of other companies i can get real estate all these other things but it comes from literally being able to do that which means that i either have to bring someone up to operate as ceo so right now your business does not have a ceo and you say that you are passive in it i would probably challenge you on that and
(05:40) say that's not true right the company has to be able to grow and innovate without you if it can do that then it passes my test of ownership right and so i i like to have a certain amount of involvement which i just said like quarterly and you know touch points and things like that but beyond those things the business must be able to operate and grow on its own and a test that i have is that in a six month period after i leave and i put someone else in charge does the company grow during that period of time not only maintain but grow in
(06:10) both top lane and profit unless there was you know some reason they wanted to make some sort of capital investment or whatever but for the most part you can use your own common sense there but that is my litmus test is six months so if i put someone new in and i give them six months does the company grow without my involvement switching to this communication cadence and i think one of the hardest and most significant things that you can do to really remove yourself from that is if you have any sort of central communication for the
(06:34) company so if you have slack or asana or some place that you that you are you know integrally involved you see everything if you can remove yourself from that if you can get off of the company slack if you can get off of the company asana so that no one can have contact with you and you can start a separate communication center which is what we have done with our portfolio we just have one slack that has all of the executives from each of those portfolio companies so they are the only ones who have direct access to us and their teams
(07:01) have access to them directly and that is how we can have far more leverage with the skill sets that we have given the opportunities the marketplace and so the important point here that i want to make is that independent of whether you plan on selling or you plan on keeping your company structuring your company so that you can sell it will ultimately give you the freedom that you want and this was something that i did not do earlier on in my career it's taken me years i mean now over a decade to get to this point and i can tell you i don't
(07:25) think i'll ever build another company again the way i used to and i think part of that comes with skill sets part of that comes with beliefs part of that is character traits that you develop over time but hopefully we can fast track that which is why i'm making these videos for you so i hope you found that valuable um hit subscribe if it was for you i'm trying to help entrepreneurs who are trying to scale their companies and just kind of show you the lessons that i've learned along the way the the key point is
(07:49) ownership is the goal not ceo ship and if we can act as owners i think we make better long-term decisions you are far less stressed about short-term nuances in the business because you have a much more long-term outlook and ultimately i think it actually better serves the business in the long run um in terms of the value that it creates for its customers so and honestly the value that the business creates for you in your life which i think most of us wanted freedom and it takes a long time to get here so anyways hope that was valid before you
(08:16) leave a comment if you like uh stuff like this and if you have other questions around these topics and stuff i love talking about um and i just want to make stuff that you thought you know that's useful for you so anyways lots of love and i'll see you next video

The Talent Grid - How I Recognize Skill in Self & Team - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) business owners i think we can all agree that one of the most important things that happens as we grow is that we learn frameworks and that's why when you look back at what you used to accomplish you know years ago it seems like you could fix those problems so easily because you have frameworks with which you've learned to think right and so uh it took me six years to build my first eight figure company six and a half to build my first eight and a half figure uh sorry multiple eight figure company because that was the the same company the next
(00:25) company that i did that was multiplied figures was it took me a year to build and the one after that took me six months and so we've gotten faster and faster and faster at doing this and now we've done over 120 million in sales across different industries and one of the key frameworks that i've developed or helps me think through things is something to share with you today all right so there's kind of three levels employees or talent right and this really applies to you or your uh your team itself because at the beginning it's you
(00:57) right and so depending on where you're at you may you may be at one of these levels or you may have to recognize it in others and i'm going to say in in three different ways so i have a nice little nine nine grid here the simplest way to think about this is in the beginning you have to learn what to do all right this these are the skills right and that's because which you are in the beginning is an individual contributor all right that means you actually have to get things done in order for them to you know happen right and so what you're
(01:26) doing at this point is you're doing right all of your time is spent doing the things right learning what to do etc now the reason it's really important to be able to recognize where you're at is because then you'll be able to look through this framework and immediately see what you need to do next to the same degree you may have gone through this but not have recognized the shifts and you can look at an employee and say i think they are in this bucket i think they are in this bucket i think they have the potential to get to this bucket
(01:52) etc many times people will stick at one level because of their own beliefs that they have about themselves which is why we you know laila and i believe that identity is very fluid if you want to be successful because you have to be able to change what you think about yourself in order to become the thing that's going to to de-bottleneck the business because ultimately it's costing every single human on earth a billion dollars a year not knowing how to create a billion dollars a year in revenue right and that's how i always think about this
(02:19) it's like it is costing me so much money my ignorance is costing me so much money and so hopefully with this video i'll break down some of the other things that you won't be ignorant to so you can recognize them in other people so level one is understanding what to do right which means you're an individual contributor and what your time is spent is doing all right the second level here is is understanding uh how all right so you started to do it right the what you figure this out but then you have to figure out how you're
(02:45) actually doing it right and the reason for that is because the next level you become a manager all right and that's making sure that other people can do that thing and they're consistently executing at a level that works right and so here what you're doing is you're teaching right you're teaching other people to do the thing right and so at the beginning you're doing right as an individual contributor you have to focus on what it is right the next level you're doing you're doing all the doing and you're like you know what i feel like i
(03:14) understand this better right i didn't feel like i understand the sequence of how this works right and then you can teach other people how to replicate that skill and at the very end i'll show you how to apply this to departments in a second all right so stay tuned for that but this is level one right as you're looking at yourself or an employee right level two is oh i think this person could teach other people i think they could manage them and as a quick caveat here like not every like managers don't necessarily
(03:39) need to know how to do something better than an individual contributor there's always going to be niche expertise etc but they should understand how it works right and so this is just an important like just nuance to note there right the third level is what i look at is the who right and i know this may sound odd it's like what and then how then who but that is kind of what it evolves to over time all right the title here is a leader all right and these are very different than managers which is something that i had to i had to realize
(04:11) as i was scaling the business and you know usually at this level this is where you're at your you know three-ish million dollar a year level and this is what allows you to you know crack crack open to the million plus uh per month level so 10 10 million pluses you have to have leaders that are engaged right the thing that you're doing here is you're systematizing all right and so what i'm gonna i'll say this a different way too because i think it's worth noting is building the machine that builds the machine all right and the reason that's
(04:43) important is because first you're doing it then you're teaching it and then you need something that can teach it for you that's kind of how this works right so it's always it's it's um it's not delegating it it's systematizing so it's really i was trying to be thoughtful about what word i was going to use there because it's like is it delegating it is it is it is it handing it off it's it's systematizing it and there's a lot of different ways you can system you know build a machine that builds the machine but if you think through this in terms
(05:09) of your own frameworks the way the reason that i like this is that you can actually grade yourself in terms of where you're at you can grade yourself in terms of where a team member is at and you can even grade departments right within your within your business which depending on what your size is your departments might just be might be things that you were doing right if there's if you're a solopreneur for example then like you wear all the hats your finance your hr your legal your i.
(05:33) t your marketing your sales your product your fulfillment your all of those things right but as you grow you know in the beginning you'll have your first core team of probably five people and they'll fulfill each one of those functions you have somebody who helps you with you know delivery you'll have somebody who helps you with you know finance who does the bookkeeping maybe somebody helps you with marketing maybe that's you somebody helps you with sales etc right and so what you can do is you can look at a department and say what level am i
(05:56) involved here right and eventually the goal is that you can move right move above right me equals you know ceo and so you have a team of leaders who are building the machine that builds the machine for you so that the actual whole thing works without your um without you being there besides providing the vision and strategic insight for making decisions right and so for me i define this within a business where i'm no longer on the slack channel so in our portfolio companies if i am no longer on the slack for that
(06:28) company meaning no one can reach me besides the one person who's in charge of that company that is what i believe is a truly uh delegated business that acts as a portfolio where you are actually an owner right i can't say the amount of times i like i talk to entrepreneurs and they're like oh yeah i could totally take this new project on like my business is totally systematized and and i'm like dude like no it's not like your phone's blowing up twice since we've been on like since we've been sitting here talking like like yeah i mean just
(06:54) because you don't have to respond to something in the moment doesn't mean that you don't have to eventually respond to it or make a decision or etc right like those are things that are still levels of involvement that require your existence and presence and so for me it's if i'm not in the slack channel i have one meeting a week with the with the owner of the owner the um with one of our portfolio companies the manager operator etc of a portfolio company and between that time and the next time the company can continue to grow without my
(07:24) direct involvement that is what i would say is checking all the boxes for me and if something's not checking all the boxes you can check all the boxes at a business level but you can also just look at this as a department level and the reason i think this is so important is that it can give you a grade that you can look at to improve so you might have you know marketing and you might have sales and then you might have you know product and then you might have you know uh shared services which would be like i.t
(07:50) legal hr all that kind of stuff right and you can look at yourself and think okay do i have in sales for example do i have people who can like am i the one doing the sales okay well maybe i'm not doing the sales well i'm the one who's teaching people how to sell okay well have i built a machine that teaches people how to sell so that i don't have to do the teaching of selling so i can actually just bring people in on a consistent basis and get them up to speed right that's where you start looking at like hiring one two three sales people a
(08:16) month right and they you put them through the machine that builds sales people right and so you can look at these levels within each of the departments so maybe maybe that's what you're that's where your sales is at right you've got a machine that builds the machine awesome but is your marketing there right do you have a machine that builds the machine there or are you still doing are you still teaching people right and here's here's one of the the things that i think for me it took a long time to realize is that
(08:40) it's actually your strengths oftentimes which which becomes almost always the bottleneck in the business because the things that you don't know you're far more comfortable giving away to people so that they can build these things right because they have better expertise because they know how to do teach et cetera and that's where you as a ceo as an entrepreneur is you actually have to walk them through these things so it's like okay great so uh you know you know how to do some whatever it is the the delivery of your
(09:05) of your product you tell someone to do that it's like great now i need you to teach someone else how to do that so we can build a team of people who are doing that so we can scale right and then finally at a certain point it's like man i'm spending all my time teaching it's like okay well we need to build the machine that does the teaching for you and so i think if you can think through this framework for each of the departments that you have in your company you'll figure out where your bottlenecks are and it'll at least give you a grade and
(09:26) so every quarter you can look at your your your business on a on a little little sheet like this and think okay do people know what to do do we have the base skill okay do we have the sequence the how to do it right teaching people step by step how to do this process right and hold them accountable and then finally can i find somebody who can help systematize and build the machine that builds the machine that recreates the skill over and over and over again and other people right and so that's kind of the process
(09:51) and what's interesting if you listen to uh reid hoffman founder of linkedin he talks about the difficulty for most employees most people to jump these levels it's very difficult for most people which is why especially like rapid rapid growth companies they'll often have to you know change out i'll say leadership with quotes here just anyone who's in charge because in the beginning there's probably more managers and over time there need to be leaders and a lot of times the managers despite their tenure aren't actually
(10:19) leaders right and so when i'm looking at talent within our own business i'm thinking okay who's a good individual contributor and sometimes sometimes amazing leaders are terrible individual contributors and sometimes a lot often times good individual contributors are terrible leaders right and so it takes a very unique person which is why being an operator so hard is that you have to really master all of these levels so that you can recognize it and teach it in other people because ultimately what we're doing is
(10:41) we have to walk the path that every person who's behind us must walk which is why entrepreneurship is such a such a growth-oriented you know occupation like you have to grow yourself in order to attract people who have who are who are at a certain level right like imagine if you're if you if you were to start working for somebody and you feel like you know way more than them and that they're just have no idea what they're doing right then it's unlikely that you're going to be very influenced by that person that person's not going to inspire you
(11:08) to do anything on the flip side if you if you were to start working for somebody and you you aspire to be like them you like their character traits you love the way they operate in their personal life and how they do business etc then that is somebody that you were being led by right and so for us as entrepreneurs like a lot of times we have to think like how can i improve my character what are the traits of mine that are deficient so that i can hopefully inspire people that i can bring people in at this higher level and then actually be able
(11:33) to execute because i can't tell you the amount of times i can't even like most entrepreneurs i've talked to i'd say 95 percent of them oh my team's amazing i love my team they're awesome and at the same time they have all these horror stories about teammates and i can't say like amount of times that i've talked to somebody they said their team was awesome and i talked to him nine months later like oh no that team wasn't awesome this team's awesome right i'm like dude the perspective in which you you make judgments is flawed and i don't
(11:54) believe anything you say because every time you've said this it has been wrong so why would i believe differently now and so these are the levels that i think of for myself my employees departments and then ultimately the business this is just a different way of thinking through it hopefully is valuable for you if you have these frameworks you can look at your own businesses apply things faster and break through the bottlenecks that you have so you can get to where you want to go if you like this you know subscribe check out one of my
(12:17) uh my next videos that are coming up and um hope you uh keeping awesome and accomplish all your roles

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i want to tell you a story that may be applicable to you if you're an existing entrepreneur or new entrepreneur or somebody's about to make a big decision in life yesterday i had a conversation that transpired between me and an 18 year old who's now a freshman in college and i think there i wish i could have recorded it but there are a lot of kind of decision points and lessons and thought processes that we walk through together that i think will be valuable for for many because it's the same it's honestly
(00:30) the same decision-making process whether you're making a multi-million dollar decision or you're making a you know relationship decision or whatever it is and so um this 18 year old kid is my neighbor i think i've referenced them before and he's entrepreneurial he did a little car washing business he's done a little uh e-commerce business that he started on his own and and it's and it's worked out you know pretty decently well for him but because of the pressures that he's had on himself and from outside he decided he had to do college and so he
(00:58) started his first semester in college and to make a long story short he did something he wasn't supposed to do and now he's in trouble and that may jeopardize his future in college and so he's obviously really wrecked about this and so i i said hey let's go for a walk and so on this walk i said you know what's what's your plan he's well i think i'm you know i think i'm gonna try and fight this thing um and uh you know give college another shot and um i i wanted to walk him through this because i wanted him to make any
(01:32) decision for the right reasons right and so i said you know do you think like what do you what's the outcome you want to have from giving another shot at college right because he didn't really like high school that much he's like well you know i just want to i want to give it a try i was like okay again what do you want to have happen or what do you think is going to happen what is the positive outcome that you're potentially looking forward to the negative outcome that you think could happen he's like well honestly i don't know and i was like
(02:03) okay now we're getting somewhere so do you think that taking you know genders literature studies and history of aztec culture whatever is going to be more interesting to you now than the stuff that you studied in high school which was again general literature is that going to be interesting to you it's like well probably not i was like okay then what's the real reason that you want to go to college it's like well you know i feel like i you know i'm a kid and i should experience you know having fun and all that kind of stuff
(02:34) and i was like okay having fun's fine do you feel like you can have fun without going to college do you think that you could not spend 200 000 in four years of your life and still have fun in that same period of time if you weren't at college but still with other people who are your age he's like well yeah i guess so i was like okay cool then i'm assuming that's not the only reason you want to go to college what else is there he started thinking he's like honestly i don't really know and so um to give you a little bit more context
(03:06) before what i told him next i asked him what do you think because he's doing his entrepreneurs he's starting a new entrepreneur thing right now with real estate and he hasn't he hasn't cracked it yet right and so i said do you think it's possible that you want to go to college because it's a it's a it's a socially acceptable shield for you not being successful in entrepreneurship do you think do you think that that might be a reason because if you're in college then you you're not seen as a failure if you're not
(03:38) winning at the thing that you're doing right it's your side hustle it's your side gig he's like well maybe yeah and i think first off you know kudos to him for being able to realize and admit that but i think that that was is such a core issue for many of us is that we present these socially acceptable solutions to ourselves when deep down the reason that we're doing them is not for the right reason and so in this instance he's using it as a foil to protect himself against having to confront the realities of life of
(04:12) business of the marketplace of not being good enough right yet and so i said all right well what do you want to have happen in your life do you think you want to have a job and he was like no i don't want to have a job like what do you want to do he's like i want to have my own business and i was like what do you think business school looks like in the real world he was like well probably doing business i was like okay so if you have four years and 200 000 if you invest that in college versus investing two hundred thousand dollars
(04:43) in four years into learning into trying to start your own business which of them after four years do you think will get you closer to your goal it was like well probably the business one and i was like okay so then right now what you have is a clear logical logical outcome in terms of which decision path to make but then now we have to start looking at what's the emotional driver that's preventing you from doing it right and so for him going all in means making the first real trade-off he's ever made in life right because if
(05:16) you're newer or you have a job or you're you know it doesn't matter where you're at in your life there a lot of times especially when we're younger there's there's fewer big branch points right but as we get older we have to commit and trade off something else right it's this for that and i think excuse me sorry um i think that a lot of times we have to frame these things in terms of the things that we're willing to sacrifice and so i told him the story of uh when i was starting my gym the mindset that i approached it with
(05:49) was i will not outwork everyone but instead i will out sacrifice anyone and so what i meant by that is i'm willing to put everything and anything that i have on the altar of my success and that's what i started from a mindset standpoint so i wasn't like i'm gonna be smarter or i'm gonna do something else i just knew that anytime my competitors or other people were going out or they were you know seeing friends or playing video games or watching football games which i used to do all the time before i started a business
(06:21) or or sleeping in or just all the many things you know even honestly my fitness even suffered during that period of time i'm not saying it's perfect but i'm saying i was willing to do i was willing to sacrifice anything to get to where i wanted to go and i introduced that kind of concept to him of like you tell me you want these things and yet when it comes time to sacrifice to pay the piper to make the trade-offs that are that are necessary to have that outcome that's when you're faltering and so do you are you willing to sacrifice for the
(06:57) things that you want in the long run i was like because he's my neighbor and we live in a nice neighborhood i said like i'm the age i am and we live here i was like i sacrifice my 20s straight up i sacrifice them and i'm not saying it's the right path but i want to make sure that whatever decision you make you make it for the right reasons if you want to go for four years in college do it by all means but understand the reason you're doing it is because you believe that four years of from college and spending 200 000
(07:26) is the best use of your time and then having the story that you'll have to tell yourself about the type of person who makes these types of decisions and then you'll have to live with that because the thing is is the stories that we tell ourselves create the identity that we that we have right one of my favorite scenes in the matrix is in the third one i know people don't like the second and third i like all three um is when morpheus is standing in front of all of humanity and he says i can tell you that i stand here
(07:57) truthfully unafraid not because of the path that lies before us but because of the path that lies behind me and i think that's such a such a deep message because where we are is because of the stories that we have that have led us to be who we've become and when we make these choices i think just as important if not more important is the story that we are telling ourselves about why we made the choices and what that tells us about who we are and so i wanted to clarify the decision for him in terms of is this what you want yes or
(08:31) no of these two paths which one will get you closer to that thing yes like this one or this one cool now why are you not making it which now goes from logic to emotion and then at that point saying okay i think we've discovered the root issue which is that you're afraid is being seen as a failure if you're not immediately successful and so what i wanted to give to him was if you fail it does not make you a failure it means that you failed and part of entrepreneurship is failure and being able to deal with failure and
(09:02) how you come back from failure and i said right now you're in this instance where this is the first real big hit life has ever given you right everything's relative but in his life at this moment this is the biggest thing worst thing that's ever happened right this bad issue that he had with his school and so i said the story that you now get to tell is what you do from here right do you use this as the catalyst to realize that you actually don't aren't interested in the school stuff and you never have been and have always wanted
(09:30) to do the entrepreneur thing but it's been a side hustle and you've never fully committed to it i was like is that is that the story you want to tell or do you want to go and try and fight this thing and try and beat it and then spend you know another three and a half years spending more money and then be another 3.
(09:49) 1 student that graduates from pepperdine right which one is the story that you want to tell and so i think i wanted to share this story with you because i don't know where you're at or what decisions you're facing but i think there was a lot of many things that we kind of covered in that conversation and unearthed and so many of us know what we need to do but have some emotional trigger that's stopping us from doing it and i think digging deep and saying like what am i afraid of happening what's my biggest fear because if i know this is what i
(10:19) need to do then why am i not doing it and i think if you can simply name the fear of what you are afraid of it allows you to face it and it removes the power it has over you because then you you have clarity and then it's simply am i willing to let my fear of failure stop me from having what i want to eventually have in my life or would i rather let that have me walk down a path that never actually helps me realize my potential and so when you think about a maybe versus a never then i'll take a maybe over and never
(10:51) any day of the week and so like i said i don't know where you're at i don't know what trade-offs are facing i don't know what sacrifices you may have to make in order to get to where you want to go but i think literally listing those things out of what you were willing to give up there was a point in my life where i i wrote down all the things that i had to additionally give up because i was at a point of just rubber meeting the road and i had to push harder and this was probably three or four years into my entrepreneurial journey and i remember
(11:16) making this video about that where i i actively gave up football on sundays which was like a thing that i enjoyed you know watching um i know that i gave up all tv of all kinds even like the wind down tv um i gave up any kind of going out and i'm not saying that you have to do that i'm just saying that that's what i did and i know that this kid's father was like hey you need to have balance you need to you need to be able to enjoy life you're still young and my father when i was younger really hit on that really hard and i
(11:53) really pushed back and i still pretty much do because i don't believe that anything great was ever accomplished by someone who is balanced i think that it takes extremes it takes extreme effort it takes unreasonable sacrifice in order to achieve things that are unreasonable and so you know and i was telling him yesterday uh the kid not my dad if you were competing against someone else who was a coder you guys are both coding software right i was like and you're going to college you're having fun you're going out on weekends and you
(12:24) know you code a couple hours a day versus the kid who drops out of college codes 16 hours a day doesn't go out doesn't see his friends just codes for three and a half years it's like who do you think will be further along he was like well the other kid and i was like right like how much further along he was like probably a lot further i was like right do you think it's reasonable or unreasonable that he would be further ahead than you he's like reasonable and i was like so why would you not want to take the reasonable bet that you will be so much
(12:53) further ahead by making that choice and so all that to say i don't know any people who are really successful who don't approach things in an unbalanced way and i think that there's a differentiation between seasons and your entire life what you do for a season of life doesn't have to be forever but sometimes it does have to be for that season and sometimes you are uneven and so sometimes it's difficult to look you know at what i do now versus what i did to get here right if i you know i sacrificed my fitness for periods of
(13:26) time right i'm not saying it was good i'm just saying i did um there were times where i did not sleep as much as i probably should have there were times where i did not see i didn't do anything social at all four months i'm not saying it was right i'm just saying that's what ended up happening and when i hear stories of many people who kind of go through the who go through their rocky balboa period the rocky cut scene almost every hyper successful person that i've seen goes through a three to five year period
(13:54) where they just get hit in the face day after day after day after day you know some of the some of the great marketers some of you guys may have heard of you know russell brunson pitched for five straight years on stages unknown before he became russell brunson you know billie jean did cold calling for two three years dan kennedy did face to face door-to-door sales for three years right i did four thousand one-on-one consultations over a four year period selling fitness doing 15 20 appointments a day right and the thing is is like i wasn't alex
(14:23) ramosey then i was just a dude who was selling and just getting better and better and the thing is that there's this unreasonable amount of effort this unreasonable amount of sacrifice that usually has to go in to get the unreasonable goal and yet people are not willing to make the sacrifice to do it and so i think if we can simply look at what is the decision that's going to get me to where i want to go which of these do i think will be better and then what is the sacrifice that's required and am i willing to make that sacrifice then i
(14:45) think it it makes much simpler decisions and we know why we're making the decisions we are so that decisions are not made for us by life so anyways i hope that was valuable for you it was just top of mind because i had the conversation yesterday and i thought man i wish i had recorded this but i don't know where you're at in your life and i don't know what decisions you're facing but hopefully this provides value for you so lots of love keeping amazing and i'll catch you in the next vid bye [Music] [Music] [Applause]

I've met Arnold 4 times. Here's what I learned. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZjJEQMgyMM

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone happy thursday i have a good one for you today um i'm calling this violence is the answer and what i learned from having four meetings with arnold schwarzenegger so um i haven't talked a lot about the stuff that we do with charity um and i don't know why i haven't done it i think it was just because i never uh i didn't want it to feel like we were bragging about anything like that and i think that's why i haven't discussed it as much um but that being said um i've got a ton of things that have been on my
(00:26) mind um and a bunch of lessons that i think that i took from speaking with arnold we had a breakfast together that was two hours long um we went to his house uh uh less than a month ago actually she was like two weeks ago um and in all of the instances i feel like i mean there's tons of things you can learn from a man like that but the big thing that i was able to take away was um i want to call it like the optimist like a delusion of optimism and what i mean by that is that once like the higher the level of success that you achieve
(01:00) the more noise and hate you will receive right and so if you think about like the amount of security we had to go through to to get into arnold's house and all of those things is like just befitting of the fact that there are people out there who send him death threats every day for just existing right because they watched a movie and their wife divorced someone for who looked like him right and so that kind of leads to the second thing which is the more impact you have the more impressions you make based on the
(01:30) scale that you have it's just law of large numbers going to be a larger percentage of bat [ __ ] crazy people that you got to deal with right and so if for some reason the negativity of a trainer or a competitor or a client drags you down then you don't have the mental fortitude for the success that you want to achieve because the condition of that success is more not less of the hate of the [ __ ] of the noise that you're currently dealing with it doesn't go away it gets louder and louder and louder and so one of the one
(02:02) of the the skills or the disciplines that we have to develop as entrepreneurs especially if we seek this impact and that's with so many people that i talk to so many entrepreneurs like i want to impact i want to help 10 000 people i want to transform lives if you want to help 10 000 people then you have to be prepared to have 500 people who [ __ ] hate you all right because anyone who does anything worth doing is going to have an equal and opposite reaction right that's how it is if you look at every single great religious leader that's ever
(02:33) happened and it doesn't really matter almost all of them died right and were murdered for what they did and most people would argue that they were probably good people but with every positive thing that you do there's going to be an equal uh reaction that's negative right and so it's a it's like i just want to say this sentence to you because it means so much to me is that hatred is a condition of success it's a condition if you have no hatred if you have no people who hate you who talk against you speak against you then
(03:03) it means you're standing for nothing like you're standing for nothing because if if there is nothing for anyone to debate against you then you stand for nothing and that means that you're not actually having any impact and so if you fear that kind of confrontation if you fear that kind of hate that kind of whatever then you need to not be in business or you need to fix that part of yourself because you will sabotage your own success you will become successful the noise and the hatred and the naysayers will increase and then you will make
(03:33) yourself less successful so that you don't have to deal with it right that's that's like real right that's what happens and so just just some of the mental things that i've that i've you know had to go you know like you have trainers and you have clients you know whatever it is right the gyms one thing that i've seen with arnold and on the flip side trump right and they don't like each other they're like arnold's outspoken against trump and all that kind of stuff but one thing that they both share that i really admire is
(04:01) almost a delusional optimism is that they all they almost don't even they they don't even address it they don't even acknowledge the presence of haters they're just like like if you see trump get attacked he just won't even acknowledge it right and listen i've never voted i don't care right but the point is like their level of of mental fortitude of being able to just exist on a plane that's above everyone else above all the noises the condition for them being able to achieve the levels that they've been able to
(04:33) achieve right and so one of the things about this that that gives me solace is that none of the hatred none of the the the trainer who leaves and starts talking [ __ ] about you none of the clients who leave and talk [ __ ] about you none of that ever affects your business it only affects you right and so um i think i think layla made a post um i don't know a week or two ago about like she was basically like if anyone talks [ __ ] about you it's because when they talk about themselves no one gives a [ __ ] right that's what they said or that's
(05:03) what her quote said and she had like seven different people message her people who were talking [ __ ] about us that we had no idea existed and so she was like god i'm never gonna make that post again right but the thing is is that this is the record this is a record month for us this is the best month in sales we've ever had right and amid that this was when she posted this post and there's all of this negativity and so you have to remember that if there is negativity there's also positivity that's coming with it because
(05:30) as as ugly as this sounds there really is no negative publicity like you know this from the from the freaking presidential election right he won because there was he owned the conversation good and bad he owned it all right and if everyone is talking about you guess who they're not talking about anyone else right and so you have to be polar you have to stand for things because that is going to bring the haters out and you should welcome it you should be like thank you for thinking about me i appreciate that thank you we
(05:58) had a record salesman this month keep talking about me i love it like feeding my bank account keep going dude keep going it's awesome right and so understanding that the law of large numbers is that the more people you impact right the more by percentage you're going to run the wrong way and so just like accept it and then always put things in context all right and so when we have our we had our quarterly meeting whenever uh you know someone from the front line or some of them from management comes up with somebody's like
(06:27) i think this is a problem i always ask all right what's the number of incidences and then how many total incidences do we and then how many total people who could potentially have an incident um are are there right so i'll give you an example um we had someone who's a manager who um was saying uh we had a gym owner who can complain about paypal that getting paid out from paypal on the prestige laptop he said i don't want to sign up um because you guys pay for paypal and i i paid paypal and she was like it really bothered me
(06:57) and i was like well how many people has this been she's like so i think we should consider switching from paypal it's like well how many people has this been an issue for she was like well one i'm like how many active affiliates we have a thousand so point one percent of people had a problem with it like don't even let it touch you you know what i mean don't even let it touch your your thought your mind because when you have scale you have 200 clients if you have five [ __ ] think about it it's two and a half percent of your entire clientele
(07:27) base what percentage of humans do you think are kind of crazy i would say at least two and a half percent at least right and so if you can if you can always take apart the problems that arise or that people bring to you and think about it in context of the larger numbers that you're dealing with i promise you will make the the noise of the world go down and you'll be able to get to that to ascend to that higher level and eventually we can get to the spiritual plane of arnold and trump and whatever you feel about them i don't
(07:57) care it's just you can appreciate the fact that they can exist on another plane and literally just live in a world of delusion where like they are untouchable because they they put themselves in this box and there is a borderline where it does become delusional because you don't take feedback but because the hate is so loud they almost can't allow it right like arnold was attacked at the arnold expo where he's like cheering kids on you know what i mean like people are crazy and you just gotta accept that so um let
(08:23) me make sure i hit all my my lovely points um yeah and so the only thing that you have left to do that actually drives your business is the four numbers that i brought up the other day is any of these things going to drive more applications is it going to drive a higher percentage of close is it going to decrease my turn is it getting smart increase my profitability and the believe it or not the haters right that you have the trainers the ex clients the whatever right the likelihood that they're going to really impact like that they know the
(08:57) majority of the marketplace is basically zero right like if you have a client who leaves it mind you i like i'm not talking about any specific client because like i'm talking about the gyms i'm saying but like if you have a client your gym who leaves right and they they know 10 people they know 20 people they start making posts right people only remember how they feel when they read that no one ever remembers what any [ __ ] talker talks about they only remember the negativity and they associate it with the person who's
(09:23) talking [ __ ] which is why one of the biggest issues that i had early on in my life i was telling you is that i used to talk [ __ ] and it was like something that i really hated about myself and so the rule that i made is that if i am going to say something that is negative i'm going to say to the person first and then if i am so if i do tell someone else i'm like hey by the way i've already told this person this this is what i think about and so that's kind of given me my like i don't see [ __ ] unless i've told the person about what i
(09:49) believe right and so that's kind of my my rule of thumb for [ __ ] talking but um i say all that to say that person who's left your business that client or whatever knows 20 people your ads are reaching 50 000 people a day what actual impact do you think they have none and so you got to think about it in terms of math right because it will literally just like put you at ease because you realize that the things that matter in the business are the things that matter this video is not going to drive sales for me right i make these partially for
(10:22) me because i like documenting the journey and i want to look back that's actually why i do this right um but me posting on instagram doesn't do [ __ ] right it doesn't do anything right these don't really do much the things that do are the things of doing the boring work of making sure that we refresh our ad content make sure we have good offers make sure that the leads are getting worked make sure that we're following up make sure that when we're on the sales calls we're clarifying whether they're we're labeling with a mobile problem or
(10:47) going over their past pain and we're selling them the vacation and making sure that we can explain how we can fill the gap right the fundamentals and all scale is is doing the fundamentals in larger numbers that is all it is and there's complexity in that but the process from a mental standpoint is simple right and so that is what's going to grow your business and so if you get distracted and you have somebody who's bugging you you have a trainer you have a client or whatever it is just go back to your numbers and focus
(11:13) on the things that drive your business because i can tell you that a any person who's speaking against you is is is confirming the fact that you are being successful it's a condition it's a condition of success if you stand for nothing no one stands against you period it's what it is right so first they're confirming that you're actually having impact second they're bringing top of mind awareness they're talking about you all the time great and then third it doesn't matter anyways all of it doesn't even matter because
(11:42) none of it is impacting the things that grow your business and so just remember that when you're spending 100 a day you're buying 2 000 impressions you're buying 2 000 people and you're buying it every day right sorry 25 five thousand impressions so you find five thousand eyeballs right and this person's organic reach is like [ __ ] a hundred it doesn't matter and so just like put it to rest just stop worrying about it like i can't tell you like it got to the point where people would ask me they're like hey do
(12:12) you want me to like send you this this stuff for other people i was like nah man i've been doing this two and a half years and when i came out i was talking against things that people didn't like there was a lot of gurus who were established when i came into this three years ago i was like i don't think lbs work here's why this is math right and they started bashing and it's like that's cool but the math is wrong right like i'm gonna be right what they should have done was copy my [ __ ] that's what they should have done and they didn't
(12:35) they postured against with pride which is the wrong move and so i'm totally going another direction but we're just going to rock with it so like from a strategy standpoint right if you're the small player what you want to do is you want to attack the methodology of the bigger player that's what you should do right but you better be right and you have to have a unique angle of why yours is better and different right now if you're the incumbent there's virtually no reason that the incumbent the person who's established in the
(13:05) market should ever lose the only reason they lose is because they're human and because they're human because they're prideful and because they don't want to accept that they're wrong there could be another way right because technically the winner should do exactly what you see amazon doing they let someone come up with something and then boom they rip off and they copy it right and then that guy's gone because they own the entire distribution network and so real talk there hasn't been anything that has come out from anyone that i have seen and i
(13:33) know because i buy everything right that has been useful right not really and so i see everything and i will not let someone do to me what i did to the people before me which was attack attack attack the methodology because you don't want to be the type of person who attacks on this character it's just it literally never looks good it's a losing battle makes you look like an ass no one remembers who you're attacking they just remember the turn [ __ ] right so wrong strategy that way you do want to attack the methodology if you have a superior
(14:05) option but the problem is if you attack it loud enough and the the eye of sauron comes to you and sees what you're doing what they should do the strategic move is to take it distribute it and then wipe you out that is how that's the game like that's the game theory and like that's how you win and so the only way to beat the incumbent is also for the account that's why that's why amazon trades like a zillion times its actual earnings because no one knows how they can beat them how do you beat them they don't have an ego about it
(14:33) they don't give a [ __ ] they're like cool you found a new toilet paper brand boom got it and they and jeff distributes it now it's his toilet paper bread right he doesn't care he doesn't have an ego about it he's like great thanks for doing the r d i appreciate that and so it's only the people who have the the the ego about being like i was the first one like no one cares right the only thing people care about is how much money you make period and that you are looking always for the next thing and so that's why that's what we came out with
(15:01) hybrid right like that's the next thing like i think down the road group i mean group training is not going away but the price points will become increasingly commoditized and the pressure will increase and the middle tier players the lower tier players are going to go out right it's just what it is and so if i'm helping the most amount of people i have to create the new or the next opportunity to shift everyone into which is going to take the next seven years of gold rush until eventually more and more people copy it
(15:28) and then we'll come up with the next thing because that's business right if you want something that's gonna stick around forever don't be a business owner it's not gonna work right same thing with marketing so anyways all this to say the reason i call this violence is the answer uh is that massive action is the only thing you can do right it's the only it's the only combat you have it's like success is the only revenge is that you just keep focusing on doing you and increasing the amount of opportunities increasing the percentage that you
(15:53) capture and decreasing the turn of your business that is all you do that is all you focus on and the rest of it does not matter ignore it it doesn't matter the only way that it starts to actually affect those numbers if it takes up your headspace it's the only way someone wins it's the only way and so if you don't want someone to win right and someone talks [ __ ] it's a client it's a trainer it's a whatever a competitor right first off understand that they're not marketing to the people that you're marketing to they're not right and their
(16:23) little itty bitty reach is irrelevant compared to how much you're spending and that's why we pay facebook because they give us distribution right just get that and then understand that none of that is anyway going to affect your business unless you allow it to affect you that's all so um that is why violence is the answer that is probably the single greatest lesson that i've that i learned and witnessed from arnold um and being close proximity with him obviously we talked about work now we talked about business
(16:47) stuff we talked about charity talk for lots of things but the principle the essence that i feel like i got from him was that he exists on his own playing field he plays his own game and he just lets everyone else react and that was probably the single biggest takeaway that i saw is that like when you get to that level you have to have this this level of mental fortitude that is almost delusional it borders on delusion but the only difference between crazy people and geniuses is that the geniuses are right it's the only
(17:16) difference right and so like if you're like we're gonna make it we're gonna make it we're making it and you do all of a sudden everything you did before was sin right and so if you have to exist in a place where you're like don't show me that stuff if you have uh you know your managers or your trainers are like hey this gym down the street like talk [ __ ] about us right if if they say that to you be like don't show me that [ __ ] the only way that it will actually affect our business is if we talk about it because it doesn't actually affect our
(17:40) business in any way you closing sales tonight yeah i'm are we marketing making more ads yes right are you doing your the five five percent retention yes great then let's just keep [ __ ] wrong right that's all that matters you keep steam rolling forward and the thing that pisses everyone else off is being unfuckable right you can't be [ __ ] with you just keep going and keep going and then the noise gets louder because they want a reaction and you just keep [ __ ] going right and you keep winning because what you do is you focus as soon
(18:08) as they get loud you focus in you focus in on the things that drive your business which is the math right it's doing the work there's nothing else right don't get in some pissing match it doesn't matter right just distracts you takes your attention so anyways um i hope that there's somebody here who that affects i hope there's somebody here who's dealing with a trainer or dealing with a client or dealing with a competitor who's talking [ __ ] who's making posts who's who's who who it's like whenever you see that just
(18:34) be like thanks for thinking about me bro i appreciate that you know thanks for talking about thanks for keeping me top of mind like much love like you got to think like that because that's the only way and that'll get even more under there and now you're in their minds and they're not in yours because you just keep doing what you need to do and that's the only way you win so anyways lots of everybody hope you have an amazing thursday and um keep being awesome i love you all tomorrow's gonna be sick all right [Music]

How To Scale Yourself: The What-Why-How Framework - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIC8fYbrkII

Transcript:
(00:00) if you don't know what i'm about to share with you you're never going to scale your business fundamentally business is a an action an asset that expands based on multiplication we're doing the same thing over and over and over again so repetition and scale are fundamental to how a business grows and so you have to understand how to scale yourself through others it's taken me a very long time to understand a very simple concept and i'm going to share it with you if for some reason in your company right you're not getting the
(00:29) outcome from the employees that you want then it is one of these three things that's the issue and i believe that simplicity you know simple scales fancy fails and so i like to keep my framework simple and the way that i discovered this was actually through reading andy grove's book high output management really really highly recommend and he's one of the all-time best operators you know in of all time he's the goat of operations and he posited that there's two things fundamentally that every manager should do and adding one-third uh one one other
(00:58) piece to this has been my personal experience and so i'm adding these two together if you don't know who we are my name is oxford mosey i own a portfolio companies that does uh just under 85 million a year we've done 120 million in the last three years let's rock you into it so how to scale yourself so the first question that i like to ask myself if somebody is not doing what i want them to do is do they know what i want them to do all right which if they don't then it's a functioning communication so if someone doesn't is not doing what i want
(01:23) them to do the first question i ask is like did you know what i wanted you to do was it clear and one of the rules that we have is it's not written it never happened all right so if you're giving a directive to somebody say hey can you do this for me that's where you follow up with slack or you fought with a son or you fought with an email because if it doesn't exist in the digital world it doesn't there's no record of it then it's like it didn't happen all right and so one of the rules of thumb is if someone's not doing
(01:44) something the first thing asks is do you know what i wanted you to do and then did i personally follow up with that via email slack asana or whatever tools you use to run your business if that's true if that has happened then i follow to the next thing which is survey training do they know how to do what i want them to do so they may know what i want them to do because i communicated adequately i documented it i put it in asana i put it in an email i put it whatever in slack so that they knew after the conversation even though i
(02:12) told them that what i expected them to do and by when right but if they're like i didn't know how to do it then i would say okay well how can i how can i help you with this do i need to provide a training for you do i need to buy a course for you do i need to hop on a call and explain it to you does another employee need to train you like does your manager need to train you like what needs to happen here for you to understand how to do what i want you to do all right so these are the first two levels of scaring
(02:34) yourself first you have clear understanding of what it is that you want them to do and i'm telling you this is the framework that i use when i'm thinking through this stuff like if someone is not executing i just have to think to myself i always assume it's my fault and i think okay well they either just don't know what i want them to do or they don't know how i want them to do it or which leads me to the third one if they know what i want them to do and they know how to do it then why aren't they doing it which
(02:58) comes to motivation right and if they're not motivated then i have to figure out why now most of the time it comes from a couple of things and i would say these are the most common ones that i have dealt with the first is that they don't understand why it's important within the larger context of the company they just feel like they're a cog within the business and they don't understand what this contributes to the business right one of the number one feelings that people or employees will have is they feel like
(03:21) what their their work doesn't matter and that's what creates you know meaningless work busy work people who just try and look busy when they're not actually doing anything and it's because they don't understand why you even have their role and that means that a lot of times it's because their manager or whatever didn't do a good job communicating it was like this is our function within the business this is what happens if we don't exist this is what the experience is like if if we do a good job this is what happens this is
(03:44) the result and just about every function of the business can be tied uh to how it contributes to the bottom line even if you're a more support or operations role like i.t if we didn't have you know information systems we wouldn't know where our tracking is for anything we couldn't make good decisions and the business relies on high quality decisions if we're in marketing we wouldn't be getting new business in if we're in sales we wouldn't be transacting if we're in customer service we'd be getting chargebacks and people
(04:06) wouldn't be happy right we have to tie and make sure that everyone understands how you contribute to the bottom line why it's important that's the first level of understanding for motivation here right the second level is making sure that they're actually bought into the vision of the company what's the mission what are we trying to accomplish who are we trying to help what problem the world are we solving this is something that i've you know i had to learn as our company scaled is that some of that soft you know woo woo like
(04:31) whatever uh culture stuff is actually really important right especially as you scale because when you scale service especially does anyone know what the two things that you scale are tell you what they are it's culture and training that is what happens when you scale decision making right that is how you scale decision making is culture and training and the culture is going to come from telling people what they need to do and why we do it and the training is there to make sure that they know how to do it when the time comes and they are
(05:02) motivated to do so right and so you can look at a lot of an employee and figure out if someone's not doing it sometimes they have two of the three so an employee for example that knows what to do and is motivated to do it and but not doing it because they don't know how they'll usually pretend that they're busy because they're so ashamed of the fact that they don't know what they're doing but they really like love the company and want to help right but a lot of times people don't advocate for themselves and so we have to make sure
(05:26) they know how now for example an employee who uh is motivated and has the training but doesn't know what you want them to do a lot of times it's just paralyzed or starts executing on things that are not relevant i've had this happen so many times it like drives me nuts someone's someone knows who knows how to do what we want them to do and they know why it's important but they're executing on things that are not priorities so they start doing extra work because they're motivated and they know how to do stuff
(05:49) that's valuable but it's not contributing to anything that's moving the company forward right they're not doing they're not executing things in alignment with where we're going as a company right and then the third combination would be somebody who knows what to do and they know how to do it but they're not motivated and this is typically i would say the the worst scenario which is where somebody just feels worthless and so these people tend to check out they're not working they're trying to avoid confrontation as much as
(06:12) possible and usually they're probably looking for other jobs and so for me i try to think most of the times they're not going to have none of them right they're going to have one or two of these things hopefully right it's not like they don't know what to do they don't know how to do it they don't know why they're even there i've had it happen and it's horrible but like most times there's two of the three that are there and you just have to figure out which of the other three is missing and that is ultimately how you can scale
(06:31) decision making and scale yourself within the company that is how you scale companies i hope you found this valuable click subscribe use this framework when you're not getting what you want from your team think about one it's my fault two which of these three things missing and how can i solve it keep being awesome the reason i made this channel is because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them hit subscribe and i'll see you next video

Serial CEO Sells 4 Companies Using This Ancient Business Strategy - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfcIUxa8Nn0

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i wanted to bring this video to you downtown coming in hot from austin uh what i want to talk about today is a saying that we have said over and over and over again in our community and some real world applications to it and that saying is don't be cute and so the first time i heard this saying was from a serial ceo he was a mercenary ceo so basically that is is a ceo who's you know once a company like a private equity firm purchases a new company they go have this kind of black book of their
(00:32) their all-star players their swat team that they drop in so that they can grow the company right that's kind of how it works and so he's one of these ceos he's one of these guys that's brought into a deal they get the company and then he grows it again for the private equity usually in a three to five year span and then they exit he's done this exit process four times and he was the one who told me this story and so he was like hey don't be cute he has this long island accent um and i was like i don't really know what that means
(01:00) he's like all right so you know when you're playing backyard football um i'm not even trying to the accent and i was like yeah he's like so you've got two you know you try and make these super fancy plays you're like right we're going to go fake left and then double fake right and then we're going to swing around and then you're going to pretend to be the quarterback and then i'm going to throw it that way right he's like what happens he's like you try it and then you know tommy fumbles the ball and you lose 10 yards and you lose
(01:24) the ball right he's like instead he's like put the two fat guys in the middle run to the right right and what is that he's like consistent yardage and he's like don't be cute and so that story has always stuck with me because it's so true in business and that's what he was applying it to but i feel like so many of the entrepreneurs that i talk to and the ones that we work with um a lot of times you know myself included like we try and be cute and we try and get fancy when it's usually the fundamentals that breed success and one of the
(01:55) biggest telltale signs i think of somebody who's newer is that they do not repeat successful actions and that's there's two types of successful actions there's successful actions that you do that yield a good result and you think oh i did that that worked let me go try and do something else rather than doing more of that thing right that's the first way the second way is where you are paying for a system or you're paying for advice or whatever and the person says do it this way and then you do not repeat their successful action
(02:23) and so this is one where a lot of times i feel like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and this is one of those instances because over the last probably week i've had three separate conversations um two with entrepreneurs are doing about three million a year and one with a brand new entrepreneur my uh my neighbor i think i've referenced them before um and when i was talking to my neighbor uh he just bought this system so he can start flipping real estate and he's doing well um and you know he was he was like i
(02:51) think i might do it this way and i was like listen until you make more than the guy who taught you that system you do the system exactly the way that it was outlined all right you don't don't get cute don't think you're you're special don't think you're a snowflake just do it exactly as it's outlined because there's a reason it's outlined that way and the two entrepreneurs that i talk to who are on our agency side who are doing about three million a year we just did a call and i was like hey what are your wins from this last month and both of
(03:21) them were like you know you know we've been doing we've been trying a lot of stuff and finally we decided to just you know do it the way that you had outlined it and we're actually seeing a lot better results and um they said it kind of the tone was like i don't have reluctance the right word but like feeling feeling silly right um about themselves that they had taken this long to do that right and the reason i'm bringing this up is that if you purchase a system if you take advice if you watch a youtube video
(03:50) of somebody who's doing better than you at something which is why you're trying to learn right and they're doing it a specific way there's a reason that they're doing it that way it's probably because they have the same goal that you do and probably suffer from the same cons that you suffer from and they've already balanced those for the best outcome right and so recently this morning i was on a call with our marketing uh team our traffic guys and i was looking at our uh funnel that we're optim we're in the process of optimizing
(04:20) and my traffic guy's like man if people knew how much we work on optimizing our conversion process he's like i feel like they wouldn't want to change anything because they know that we've probably already tried it and i wanted to at least pay homage to that because right now we're maybe i'd say three weeks into optimizing this conversion process of series of pages and copy and messaging and whatnot and even in those three weeks we've already tested over 100 different pieces of this conversion process this funnel
(04:52) the series of landing pages messaging etc and so that means we've changed the headlines a handful of times we've changed the buttons we've changed the flow of the pages we've changed where each one leads multiple times and so these iterations stack and stack and stack and so if i'm going to eventually show someone hey this is how it works what do you think the chances are that if they change something it's going to be better probably low right and so the thing is is that we somehow you know i think it's an ego thing as entrepreneurs like we
(05:21) always think we're special we think we're different we think we're smarter or whatever um but my word of my my rule of thumb for me is until i'm doing as well or better than the person who taught me this thing do not change it replicate before you get fancy right and so that's where you know doing the boring work don't be cute those kind of things we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught like those sayings are pervasive in our community because i think they are the things that are the bedrock of successful entrepreneurship
(05:51) and it's repeating successful actions and there are certain points where once we get this conversion process optimized where i think it should be i probably won't change i won't be pushing as much attention to that i'll be pushing more of my attention towards filling the top side right so right now we just i'm putting enough attention on bringing in traffic so that i can find the optimal way of converting that traffic but once i feel like the numbers are optimized i probably won't tweak that very much because now it's a
(06:21) successful action and i want to repeat it as many times i possibly can and then i'm going to be focused all of my attention on bringing traffic into the top of that conversion process and so as a total side note because that's what these are for i guess um if you are in the process of optimizing something which if you're using someone else's templates or anything like that then use them the way they are there's a reason they are that way but if you're coming up from these things from scratch what i can tell you is that after having
(06:49) now done this i've done this optimization process a zillion times in my life now the the headlines and the messages the top that literally the first one to two things that someone reads are going to have the biggest swing on the needle and so many times i've spent hours and days and weeks optimizing the bottom part the the the images and the pages and the sorry not the pages the um like the the copy bullets and things like that that are below the fold right on the newspaper if you if you flipped it open there's a fold and then you can flip the
(07:20) second half landing pages work the same way above the fold is what someone sees when they land on their desktop or on their mobile phone that's above the fold below the fold is everything else i routinely have seen changes of doubling to quadrupling the throughput of a page meaning the percentage of people who click to do the optimal action you want them to do simply by changing the sentence at the top or the sentences at the top and the one image that someone sees and so if you are trying to optimize something
(07:50) if you're if you're below if you're way below where you need to be don't even worry about anything below the fold and in fact you could probably spend 90 of your attention above the fold and get way higher returns than your time than everything below the fold and i can't say the amount of times we're literally just deleting everything below the fold got us better better throughput on those types of pages and actions than even putting anything there to begin with right and so um just recently i changed the headline of
(08:19) our landing page for agencies who are going to be partnering with us for our allen software and uh we 3xed the the throughput of that one page simply by changing the headline right and on our scheduling page which is the third step in this process we 5x the throughput by removing a headline that was there we didn't even add anything we literally removed something that was there and so um which was hey you know you finished this process the next step is this we just took out you finished this process basically and so people are like oh i'm
(08:54) not done i need to take this next step and so it's just this huge massive jump by removing something that was there and so all of this at least for me is this continuous reinforcement that we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught we need to repeat successful actions when they're there if someone gives this advice or we're taking advice from someone especially for paying for that advice to not take advice is akin to literally burning your money right because this person or this youtuber or this this thing that you're you're
(09:20) trying to learn from this person you're trying to learn from has already suffered the consequences of trial and error and so why would you not at least just duplicate replicate their process and what they're doing first and then when you surpass or at least match them then and only then you will have the understanding of the process to improve it and the thing is is a lot of times people become experts because of how many failures they have if the first time you stepped the plate you hit a home run you may not know why you did that is it
(09:54) because of your hip stances because when you dropped your dropped your elbow was it because you kept your eye on the ball like there's so many other factors but if you want the shortcut to getting to where you want to go replicating other people's success repeating successful actions both on yourself and what other people have done is one of the shortest paths to getting there and so anywho don't be cute don't try and get fancy don't run the the super crazy whatever play just look at the fundamentals follow the steps
(10:22) only iterate after you've duplicated the results of the person you're trying to learn from and so um that was my message for you today that was top of mind the same advice i gave the 18 year old my neighbor who's flipping real estate right now really proud of him and the same advice i give people we're doing 3 million plus a year is don't be cute repeat successful actions we need to be reminded more than we'd be taught and then just keep doing the same things over and over and over again and you will get outsized returns so anyways
(10:53) have a happy day hope your marketing is converting like crazy money um and leading you to financial wealth and freedom um only to realize that it is empty and that uh in the process you will turn most of the people that who know you secretly against you they won't purposely tell you that but they secretly envy you and that's okay because i'd rather be invid than pitied so with that have an amazing day and i'll catch you guys on the flip side bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Warren Buffett’s #1 Rule for Business Owners - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPEjYEihZ1s

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going everyone in this video i'm going to show you the number one mistake um that i made and that i see a lot of entrepreneurs making in terms of how to make money from more money from their business so the number one metric that i track for our businesses is this one and you may not even have heard this one but i think it is the most important and warren buffett agrees with me all right it's net free cash flow all right say it and then imprint it into your minds all right and obviously this depends on what type of business you're running
(00:32) but what net free cash flow is is the amount of money that an owner of a business can take out of the business after the business reinvests in staying ahead of the competition and maintaining its competitive advantage right and so the problem with the vast majority of businesses and or business owners is that what they do is at some level i mean the first problem is that many of them don't make any profit right so that's probably like problem number one and when you say i'm reinvesting the business and the reality is that you're not making a
(01:01) profit you need to be real with yourself that's probably what's happening category two is the type of businesses that are making a profit but then they take that profit and they reinvest it back into the business now i'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad idea i'm saying that for me in my entrepreneurial experience i like to take money out of businesses i like to make money while i'm growing businesses and this comes hard learned because in my first five years when i started my businesses at the time i was starting gyms i had an online
(01:36) fitness coaching business too whenever i would make money from my gym i would open up another location which sucked right um i mean it sounds great and but i was asset rich and cash poor all right and that made a pretty problem that you were suffering from too i had equipment i had leases i had flooring i had signage i had lobbies i had front desks i had glass walls i had all of the things except for money in my bank account and what ended up happening is i actually at after after three four five whatever years it was um
(02:09) when i sold those companies i ended up getting out of them relatively quickly and i took all the money i got from those sales which i would consider like short sales they were kind of garage sales i pretty much sold them as assets rather than as businesses because i wanted to do this new thing which was gym launch um but what ended up happening though is i took all that money and i went into a new venture so gym launch happened after this but there was a little period of time there where i uh did something new with a partner that
(02:34) i thought was gonna be partnered with and i'll just say in short terms it didn't work out and so what ended up happening is i didn't get a ton of money for the gyms that i sold and then all that money disappeared and at that moment i promised myself i'm never making the mistake this mistake again because what ended up happening is that after all those years and all that you know all that time and the money that i had made all of it was gone i was like i've made millions at that point dollars in revenue right and i had i had nothing
(03:04) you know what i mean and so i see this a lot and the thing is is that a lot of us entrepreneurs have this dream that someday we're going to sell the reality is the chips are stacked against you all right 99 of businesses don't get sold ever right and so this idea that we're going to have this mythical exit someday right for most businesses isn't true and of the of the businesses that it is true many of those exits aren't as sexy as they may sound like right like i technically exited those businesses but it wasn't like
(03:32) you know i wasn't set for life right you know what i mean i think it was like multiple it was like 200 grand 300 it wasn't a lot of money um that i made from those i think i sold all in all uh covering partnerships and all that stuff i think i all in got 200 grand i think for selling six locations like it was just not a lot right and if you've been doing this for years then that exit if you've been like i've been doing this at that time i think for four or five years like that's like 40 grand a year right if i had been just ripping cash
(04:04) out of the business and stacking it the whole time i would have had a lot more money than that at that point right and so this is a mistake that i see a lot of entrepreneurs make is that they're not focused on this net free cash flow right they're not thinking how can i take money out of this business every single year how can this business pump out profits while i still continue to grow it and some of that also comes from the expectation of how quickly i want to grow so a lot of times we want to grow really fast for no
(04:30) reason only the arbitrary reasons that we set for ourselves and the expectations of others that we project right but there's really no reason to do it but we end up just growing irresponsibly and then in so doing do it wastefully and expose ourselves to higher risk and more mistakes and in the process also lose the one thing that we get along the way if you do it the right way which is net free cash flow as in like getting paid to grow your business i remember i sat down with some of my employees um probably eight years ago i
(04:57) was actually at the gyms and i think they had said that they wanted to get a raise or something like i can't remember what it was and i was like do you understand the difference between like imagine working for an entire month right working your ass off every hour of the day right and then at the end of the month not only did i not pay you i just cleaned out your savings for working that hard and they're like yeah that would suck and i'm like that happens to me all the time right and so that's the thing is we take
(05:25) on so much risk and you start to get used to the risk because you've just been doing it for such a long time but you have to reward yourself for the risk that you were taking all right now um the reason that i like net free cash flow is that it focuses the entire company on not just making a profit but making a profit in excess of what is required to continue to run and grow the business all right and so um this is the number one stat that i look at this is what i have my financing report on for all of our entities
(05:55) because this is the real real this is owner earnings this is what warren buffett and charlie munger calculate with the companies that they want to buy because they're like we hate companies where we buy them and then we take all the profit and have to reinvest all that money back into the same business right they're like that sucks that's why they said they don't like manufacturing and they don't like a lot of types of companies where you have to have all these capital expenses meaning money expenses that you buy big stuff
(06:18) that you you know depreciate over time they're like that sucks right and so um net free cash flow is the stat that i track and if you're interested at all um i was reading a book recently called uh the little book that beats the market really good book you can read in one sitting really fascinating actually and he posits that there are only two metrics that are really important for tracking for really getting above average returns all right the first is the p e ratio which is the price to earnings ratio and if you think about what warren
(06:48) buffett talks about in terms of buying businesses he says you want to buy good businesses for cheap prices right so the figuring out whether it's a cheap price is going to be the price to earnings ratio how much how much net free cash flow how much how much earnings is this company creating not that those are the same thing but i'm saying generally right um how much how many what's the earnings of this company and what's the price for those earnings all right so this is number one so ideally you want a really low price for
(07:11) really high earnings now the second thing is uh return on capital and so what that means is now imagine a company that has i'll give you two scenarios let's say we've got a company that um you know let's say they make a million dollars in profit and when they reinvest a million dollars in profit into their company uh let's say it's opening locations just for whatever reason right so they open a new location and fro it cost them a million dollars open location and then that location gets them a hundred thousand dollars a
(07:39) year in additional earnings all right that's a 10 return on capital right that's what that means now let's take an alternative scenario let's say that another company um for a million dollars can open 10 locations and each of those locations can do 100 000 a year right that would be a 100 return on capital and so the beauty of these two metrics is the pe the price to earning ratio tells you this is a is the price of the business we're buying this is a cheaper business right the return on capital tells us the quality of the business that we're
(08:13) buying which is how good is this business a great business is a business that can take a small amount of money and generate lots of cash from it right and so by combining these two things finding the companies that have the lowest p e ratio with the highest return on capital you can consistently beat the market that was kind of the premise of the book which actually really interesting they um they used this algorithm that did these two things and they beat the the s p 500 which is basically i want to say impossible
(08:36) it's it's very difficult to do for most people and they beat it for i think like 25 years which is nuts by a big percentage which was crazy the thing is is that the companies that are usually in this bucket are usually companies that are going through issues and so you're basically buying mispriced bets right and half the companies that you buy that that meet these two qualifications end up tanking but the other half that might have had some bad press because of something are disproportionately discounted in pricing and as a result
(09:04) in the future they they outperform uh the price that you're paying for them right and so to to bring the wagon back around here as business owners net free cash flow is my home base this is what i care about this is the money that i get to deposit at the end of every month because tomorrow may never come we may get outlawed our business may be outlawed there may be there may be some horrendous thing that happens that blows your business up you may have to move locations and stop everything that you're doing and you just don't know
(09:34) and so what we are all exposed to that we discount on a regular basis is something called operational risk we are all exposed right and so if you're doing this for one year two year five years solely with the hope that someday you're going to sell well i just want to break the news to you that you have a 99 to 1 chance of not actually succeeding doing that and so you might as well take some money out of out of the business every month so you know you make money along the way and i can promise you having done it
(10:02) both ways taking money out of the business every month is way more fun it's also way less stressful all right because this is gonna be the stuff that allows you to know every month how we're really doing when you always leave it in the business account you always leave it in there you just don't have a feeling for it but you should be able to deposit money in your account this month and be like this is better than last month or this is worse than last month and you got to feel that not just the numbers but literally what you put into your account
(10:26) all right and so i'll give you one easy tactic um that i was working with one of the one of the companies that i have um an equity interest in um let's let's imagine you've got a big bucket of money all right this is your bank account for your business every month you know after a certain amount of months what your projected fixed costs are going to be all right now what i asked this entrepreneur to do uh because he wasn't taking profit out of the business so i was like hey we're going to fix this right now is you need to come up with a line and
(10:56) you say this is our line this is our non-negotiable everything over this we take out every month all right so everything over a hundred grand everything over 500 grand we're going to take out of the business every single month we're going to clear this right all the way down to the bottom and by doing this you hold yourself accountable to this level all right and so to wrap this puppy up if you're not taking profit out of the business i'd highly recommend doing it number one number two if you're not measuring net free cash flow you
(11:25) absolutely should because you're losing out on one of the most important metrics this is what charlie marker looks at this is what warren buffett looks at this is what i look at not that i'm in the same category as those guys but once i switched to this in terms of my finance and reporting it really clarified it for everything just not just for me but also for my team all right and when you're looking at businesses in general if you're thinking about reinvesting in the business make sure that the dollars that you're
(11:46) choosing to reinvest you're getting the best return on capital you possibly can all right so if you're reinvesting the business and you think you're going to get 10 back we might as well just put it in the smp and get that right and not even have to deal with all the mess and that's okay if you make a million bucks a year you make 500 000 a year and you just put it in the s p every single year you're gonna be really really wealthy right and that's okay and so sometimes your wealth doesn't necessarily have to be generated
(12:13) all entirely from your business or from a sale that you someday hope to achieve that may not actually happen okay that's all i got for you so that's my my my moment for the day net free cash flow track it stack it and make sure that you empty your bank account every single month and stack the right account which is your personal bank account lots of love catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone it's alex and moses here and if you're new to the channel um built three companies that did 110 million dollars in sales and continued to do so now we invest in other companies as well um and one of the talks i want to talk about today is the money ladder uh and so this was actually came up during a conversation i was having with layla my wife um and she was like you should make a podcast about this she's like because you know a lot of people don't know how this works and um so right now i'm writing a
(00:23) handful of books around a one of them is kind of wealth beliefs that that changed my life um and then i've got a bunch of books on acquisition stuff that's coming out so what's the money ladder that's what i'm calling it but basically it's the order in which people get paid and a lot of times like one of the biggest beliefs in my life that changed as i got wealthier and that changed before i got wealthy that caused me to become more wealthy was how i viewed the flow of money all right so what i mean by that is if you
(00:48) look at who gets paid when right when money flows you can see typically where where and who is making who has the most control and who's making the money all right so think about it from a concept of work and payment all right so at the bottom here you have an employee in general all right and there's nothing wrong with this right ever like i was an employee too so like it's not that there's anything wrong it's more so that like this you just have to understand how it works from a hierarchy standpoint what happens with an employee is that
(01:20) they work first right they work first and then they get paid two weeks later so they front their labor they front their time and then they get paid two weeks later right or four weeks later depending on what the job is right so that is if you look at the money flow they have cost of time cost of effort that goes out and then delay and then they get paid right now if you've got somebody who's self-employed this is kind of like a lot of contractors vendors gig economy etc these people typically there's they're trying to choose scenarios here one is
(01:55) and and you can see because these people are a little bit more flexible you'll see them kind of move on this money ladder so on one on the total i'd say worst side of the equation the lowest side of the equation they basically model the same thing that an employee would um that a normal employee would set up which is they front the work and they get paid later right um later you know if they get better and better and they become truly more independent contractor type things then they might get paid half up front and then half
(02:20) upon delivery right so it's kind of like 50 50 right um and then later right then they start moving up this ladder some of them will get paid up front or as they as they work etc right so the next one is paid first right so think about this if you if you go to a doctor right they don't do the surgery and then they get paid they get paid and then they do the surgery right and so if you think about your work like that or your business like that you get paid first right now um this is where like payment plans and things like
(02:59) that like the more someone pays upfront and then i would say like in full right that's another kind of mini variable here right are they paying somewhat a front are they paying all upfront or whatever um getting paid first is another level of kind of wealth and and kind of control and power all right now but notice if you're looking at this from the video we've still got we still got a little bit of ways to go up here right so then about above this right this is kind of like this is kind of where i see people ending and then you kind of get
(03:32) into like the business side of it right so um above this you'd have like banks right so what do what do banks get so banks have something called a capital stack so this is what i mean by that is when you when you buy your house right you're actually the bank's really buying your house and then you're paying the bank back the bank is a preferred creditor what that means is if you know hits the fan they get paid first and then whatever is left over is yours right that's how it works that's why you repay your mortgage when you sell your
(04:08) house and then whatever's left over the scraps go to you right banks get paid first they're preferred creditors and so when you're thinking about like money in general look at where the exchange flows right is who's fronting time and then getting paid or who's splitting it up up front or who gets paid in full right and then if goes bad who's the one who gets paid out first and who's left with the scraps now i'd say that there's one one thing above banks here which i would say is insurance this is really interesting i've learned a lot
(04:42) about interns over last year so insurance is fascinating insurance gets paid far before they ever have to do anything think about that you pay your insurance for 20 years before they have to fulfill what they are do and they also can not end up having to fulfill anything and you just get paid they just get paid for 20 years for truly doing nothing right if you really think about how the money flows like really think about it for a second imagine you have a business imagine i started signing people up for an insurance business you know alex
(05:18) hormozy you know insurance um and i just started going around saying hey i'll ensure your life hey i'll enter your life hey you enter your life right and people just start saying sure i'll sign up and they start paying me a thousand dollars a month and i've got 100 families 500 families who start paying me a thousand dollars 2 000 a month i'm doing a million dollars a month and i do that for decades right and then as people you know come to term because of how i wrote the contracts or whatever this is obviously a shitty way
(05:46) of doing it but candidly it does happen um you know they might not qualify or they can no longer afford the fees because i increase the fees as they become higher and higher risk right of actually me needing to fulfill this stuff so the point is is that if you look at insurance it's basically the opposite of a depreciating asset so when you when you depreciate a building so you buy something and then you depreciate in your tax a lot of people see that as a good thing it's like oh yeah we can depreciate it that it's only
(06:15) a good thing because in your mind because the tax code not because it's actually good that things get old and become outdated right think about it so insurance is the reverse of that so instead of putting all your capital up front and then having depreciate something over time insurance companies get all the money up front and then they get to appreciate the money over time and then pay you off of that right and there's a reason that insurance companies the oldest companies in the world the oldest ones are you know 180 200 300 years old
(06:44) and it's because that is a business model that is unreal they even i mean they predate the tax code they don't have to pay taxes so um interesting so when i think about this stuff um this was uh this was uh hopefully this is valid to be valuable for you when you think about um and you know actually i'll put i'll put one level above this the top level i'll say god and franchisors um obviously i'm not saying franchise words are god it's kind of just being funny don't get personal all right and so the last level above this is that
(07:17) god gets 10 off the top period for life and so that's how you can see the money ladder right all the way at the bottom people front their time from their effort from their labor they delay and then they get paid they move up to self-employed they front their time or they split you know they get half now half later um and as they move up this ladder they get paid more up front right a lot of that's because of demand because of how good you are right you're a doctor you get paid first before you do your surgery right if you're if you're a professional
(07:53) you're a great consultant something like that you get paid up front right beyond that you've got banks who uh they get paid first and they they leave people to scraps afterwards so that's when there's a defined pot of money above that you've got insurance companies who get paid the whole time and then may or may not ever have to fulfill on their their work right so them there they get money guaranteed but the work that they have to fulfill on is not guaranteed think about that right and then above that you've got god um who gets 10 off top
(08:23) line of what you make so um i hope this was valuable for you this is the money ladder as i see wealth and as i've as i've thought of these things as time has gone on um i shifted my views around it i changed the way we did agreements all that kind of stuff um and so hopefully you find some value in it so this is one of the beliefs that changed my life that um that made me a lot wealthier is watching where the money flows watching where it goes and watching who gets paid when keeping awesome bye

What I Learned After Countless Failed Business Partnerships - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) welcome to the call today i want to open the floor up to ask you guys because i'm sure because it's been it's been 30 days since last time we spoke so if you guys have questions in the chat burning burning things decisions that are impending things you are unsure about strategies that you need to validate or even just a a verbal high five please put in the chat and then um i'll go i'll go from top to bottom jason bring you on a business partner don't do it and go ahead so i've had this business for over a decade and legion's just ne
(00:35) it's always been my weakest function and um i'm more i follow you real quick what's that can i pause you real quick on that one how many hours a day do you spend working on legion not a lot because i get caught up in other stuff yeah so so you think about doing a partnership with kyle and you're making the consideration you want to know the decision process is that right uh yeah i mean a i want to know if it was a good idea which i know there's risks involved so then i'm like what what are the risks and what consideration i'm meeting with elizabeth
(01:09) morgan this evening to bring up my concerns but i wanted to get your feedback because you've probably seen a lot you've been i've had eight filled partnerships so i know nothing about this is you have to have re like talk about all the ugly [ __ ] first yeah right so right now you guys are in lust right you guys are like making out getting you know having having sales sex and just like it's things are amazing right you don't want to have the really ugly like how are we going to split up alimony if we you know if we get divorced later conversation
(01:36) exit strategy all that yeah so like that's what has to get defined and you now could define roles and responsibilities the only reason to have a partner is if if they have skills you do not have or they have money you don't have or they have time you don't have if you're on the flip side like you have money and they have time right so that's where that's where partnerships are useful the number one way most people do partnerships though is like hey i'm cool you're cool we love the same thing let's go into business together
(02:04) which is a terrible way to do a partnership because one of you is not necessary right and you're just diluting your equity said are you looking at doing a true partnership or are you looking on doing like a minority type deal um i would always maintain a majority and it would be a scaling you know my big company's an s corp so he would basically get a piece of the company as he helps me hit certain million dollar milestones at to the point of max maybe like a third of the company okay well that's that's different that's
(02:35) more like a performance-based relationship with kickers i would i would structure it as phantom equity which means what so it's equity that doesn't actually invest unless there is a sale and if he were to leave then he doesn't get the equity and so you can pair those two things together so you can do like equity with profit sharing and so that that would be that would be probably how i would structure it either profit or rev share depending on you know how you negotiate it okay but just as a just a side note for
(03:13) everyone on here like i remember i had a mentor really early on he's like and i was i was taking on all these partners left and right because i didn't know what i was doing and uh he's like listen you're gonna need an accountant he's like you just pay the accountant he's like he's not a part he's not a partner in my business he's like i just pay an accountant right so it's like just because you have a need doesn't mean they have to be equity owner right there's plenty of companies that are owned by people who are not lead
(03:36) generation specialists you know so i think if it were me i'd probably try and set up a really lucrative relationship that isn't necessarily a partnership so i'd say like you know it's pay per or eight percentage of something something to that extent right i don't know if you're ever planning on selling because the only reason someone would ever want equity is if they want control or they want to be able to make money on an exit so the only two reasons you want equity otherwise equity sucks because then you just have liability
(04:06) which blows so unless he wants control which i don't think he does and unless you think you're gonna sell which i don't think you are or i don't think you want to just you've been doing it for a decade unless you're just sick and tired of it but i don't get that impression right so then the only thing that that he should want or that you should probably negotiate for is the stuff that he wants which is a percentage of revenue or percentage of profit based on xyz so i think that's what you should i don't think you need to make this an equity
(04:30) partnership at all i think you just need an agreement um okay does that make sense yeah you need an import a performance agreement this is like standard you know there's tons of e-commerce companies that like they take ten percent of top line from from sales attributed to the marketing that they make and they're full service they don't have equity in the company but they get they get a percentage of revenue got it yeah i guess i have to see or talk to kyle and figure out like why would equity matter to him because
(05:04) yeah i'd be like just say what do you want or the or control but right just ask what do you want he's probably gonna say i want to participate in the upside cool what specifically because if it's sale i'm not going to sell so what specifically i want to p i want a piece of what i'm bringing it cool so then let's do it based on do exercise x or y for you it'd be advertised to do profit share for him it'd be advantageous to do a rupture it's up to you right okay that makes sense and the next question looks like it's relevant
(05:36) peter's gonna exit yeah okay so peter this is for you how to sever ties with a business partner and best practices go separate ways so it depends on whether you have a kid or not right and how good looking the kid is and how much money the kid makes right and so you guys have a business if the business isn't making a ton of money then most of these times you can just be like hey man like why don't we just both [ __ ] off and go our separate ways it's even worse than the business isn't making any money and has debt that needs to be paid off so then
(06:04) you can just i mean then at that point you should just split the debt if you want to if you like you can split the debt or you can um is this an llc that you are ending or is this in general so so the way the business is set up is it is an llc and then i have obviously my own agency so the to the idea was to use my agency to generate sales to then pay the debt of the other llc back however um i'm responsible for the back end he's responsible for the front end like the sales yeah last six months he hasn't really
(06:39) brought in any sales so now that i'm selling and doing everything exactly it becomes their point of like okay this debt is 50 50 however if i'm doing 100 of the work why should i also pay 100 of the debt and fulfill the product and do everything else on the back end yeah i mean trying to figure out like how to uh rip that band-aid off and say you know the easiest way to easiest way to have have hard conversations is just ask the questions that you ask here so like literally the biggest hack in all of relationships is the way that you
(07:15) talk [ __ ] about someone behind their back is literally what you should just tell them so it's like hey man you said that you were gonna do all the sales and i was gonna do the back end well you're not doing the sales but we're still both responsible for this thing so what do you think's fair you'll have what you have in mind but a lot of times people who once you once you present the information like that it'll be like ah [ __ ] you're right you're like so what do you think's fair he's like well you should just take the
(07:41) business and um i guess i can try and start paying off my my share over time you're like cool that's what i was thinking too let's sign these that way the you know the things dissolved and then uh you transfer your equity to me and you have a note back to me for 50 of the debt cool does that make sense yeah you can google promissory note template one page it's just like from borrower to lender no interest x amount by this paid by this state in this increment like what what happens if they default and that's it like it's a very simple like i've done
(08:23) million dollar loans on one page like you're there they hold up and you're in real estate so you should find plenty of promise orders that are simple yeah that makes sense so there's the equity that's where investors are to our lenders right so i want to make sure like so this the equity and the debt so there's two pieces right the equity you just say hey i own 100 of this company you're giving your shares to me because you're not doing [ __ ] right that's number one or we dissolve the company i create new entity i'd
(08:52) prefer to say 300 what's up to you right the thing is is you could do that right now it doesn't like and you could just say like i don't really give a [ __ ] if you sign this and it saves me 300 bucks like this is not really discussion because there's nothing here right the the second piece is uh is okay now let's now that we've dealt with the equity piece now let's deal with the debt piece right and so the debt piece this is what we both owe this is what we agreed on this is what i will do and this is the promissory note that you
(09:16) can write you know or we can both sign together towards the lenders okay make sense and then you get then you're done yeah and then as far as his involvement my agency just he can quote unquote sell my product and earn a commission and do whatever he seems with it or or not because that's the other you know tricky part is he's also involved in my agency but more so because you guys are making any money so it's not like he's gonna start making money now yeah okay right yeah that's kind of what i'm thinking as well
(09:51) yeah it's like let's let's obsess about the fact that it's like what if he gets rich on my products he wasn't getting rich on your [ __ ] product for the last two years so like i don't think it's just you know what i mean you know my my thing was like i wanted i want him to pull some sales in for us to actually sell the product because then we would actually pay the other thing that's fine then i would say and on top of this i'll still continue to give you the the thing you can still sell it and you know we split the revenue whatever
(10:14) yeah okay cool sweet

Transcript:
(00:00) what i want to introduce to you is just one of the many vehicles that exist to incentivize employees and it's called phantom equity so i was having a conversation with a newer business owner and he was talking about how he had this person who was good at marketing and he wanted to give them a percentage of his business but not the whole business in order to do his marketing and after talking about it a little bit more it became clear that it really should just have a performance relationship and not give up equity
(00:24) but one of the key things is that there are positions that are more difficult to measure within a business that it does make sense over time to you know give some sort of equity to an employee because i have realized over time is that in order to grow my slice of the pie it's better to get a bigger pie and have more people get wealthy and so having other people use my business as a vehicle for their wealth has ultimately allowed me to gain leverage on how i can increase my own wealth and one of my rules of life is the more money i make
(00:52) other people the more money i make and that is not just limited to your customers it's also applies to your employees and that's been something that it took me much longer than i expected much longer than i had hoped to learn so hopefully i can transfer that lesson to you faster sam walton even talked about this in his book made in america how he said one of the biggest things that influenced walmart's growth is when they created their employee stock option program and by doing that he said there was such a tremendous amount of buy-in
(01:17) that the company just continued to roar and grow and he said he wished he had done it sooner and so taking the advice from that man and somebody who's made much less money than sam walton myself what i want to introduce to you is just one of the many vehicles that exist to incentivize employees and it's called phantom equity this is something that i have used in every company that i own uh believe it or not i've used phantom equity to incentivize high level employees in just about every company and it happened because i actually had
(01:42) someone use it with me as an affiliate so i was an affiliate of a big software company and the ceo flew out and was like hey how can i make this really worth it for you to like push this and i was like listen man like i i enjoy the you know affiliate commissions uh but i for me to really make this like a focus i would need some sort of equity on the upside he said well what if i instead of giving you equity um i can give you phantom equity and i was like what's that and so he explained it and i want to explain
(02:06) you know to the extent that i understand it as an entrepreneur explain it to you as we've used it so i'm going to break this down to the employee and the owner all right now in this case the example i just said i wasn't an employee but i i still have treatment i'll use the employee as the example here all right so there's a couple different variables that you can think through about phantom equity so fandom equity is simply put equity that is not vested but has events that can trigger its vesting vesting means whether it's it's happened
(02:33) or not like does that equity exist it is it yours or not has it vested all right so the first thing is famine equity is typically triggered upon a sale or a change in liquidity now there's variables all of this stuff is negotiable all of these things have variables so i could say for example the phantom equity vests or you are able to participate in a transaction of the company if ownership changes if majority ownership changes so that would be a clause that i could say if i sell a majority of the company then you can liquidate your
(03:02) shells along with me now the reason that you might not include something like that is because a buyer might not want the key employees to leave with the liquidation event so that's something that would protect the owner now if you wanted to say hey i want to do it so that you guys can participate then you could also put like you can sell up to this amount or you can sell a proportional amount so there's lots of different caveats here but big picture most people have the phantom equity so that if there is a transaction of some
(03:25) sort the employees can also participate in it and build their own wealth alongside the objective of phantom equity is to get owner-like thinking and owner-like engagement owner-like behavior among people who are not majority owners of the business and a lot of times this makes a ton of sense like i used to be so stingy with equity early on well in the very beginning i was really really loose with equity and then i kind of like swung back the other direction didn't want to give anyone equity and i feel like now i've kind of
(03:50) fallen in the middle path of i don't need to give huge chunks away to people i need to find people who are key key players and give them phantom equity that is proportional the effort and the contribution that they have right i used to give away disproportionate chunks and i ended up paying for it and then later i ended up trying to find ways to incentivize hot incentivize and attract high level employees and the best people want a stake because winners win and they want they know they're going to win so they want to
(04:12) have be able to participate in the upside so number one uh that is where sale is triggered the second is that it's beneficial from a wealth standpoint because the employee can increase the value of their wealth their stake their phantom equity by increasing the value of the business right and the beauty of that is that it's entirely tax free now the owner and employer completely aligned on this one together now from a tax standpoint the reason you do fandom equity instead of normal equity is that if you give normal equity
(04:35) the employee also gets the downside of equity all right so this is good for the employee right it's good because the employee doesn't have to buy the equity because normally if you actually have an equity transfer a true transfer then what happens they actually have to pay tax on it because they're getting something right i can't just zuckerberg can't just give you know all of your shares to facebook to somebody they have to pay taxes on it right and so you can't that is a taxable event when you transfer equity so you make it
(04:56) phantom equity because it doesn't technically invest unless a trigger occurs and so what that does is it means that they don't have to get taxed on it right which is beneficial you know for the employee right now the downside of this though is that typically it will get triggered as regular income during the sale now there's ways of writing this i'm not going to get into the complexities around this but this is kind of around the vesting schedule which is when are they going to get this so for example you could say i
(05:19) want to give you five percent of this company and i want to give it to you over five years which means you get one percent a year for the next five years and you could say hey i want to create a cliff which means that after the first year the entire first percent vest then after that every quarter another point two five percent fest after that so that means that at you know month nine they're still zero investing and then at month you know 13 they'll have one percent that will have vested in its entirety and then
(05:43) after that it's it's piecemeal right what happens if the employee leaves now one of the benefits to this and this protects the owner is what if you say you know someone comes in they're a hot shot they're you know smooth talking and they're like yeah man i want to phantom equity whatever and they and you're like sure i'm going to give you five percent over the next five years right and let's say they they leave within you know x period of time now a upon the termination of the employee you can have them not get those um and you can also write
(06:10) that into the original green which means that if you leave you lose your phantom equity right which also gets people to stick with it over the longer term which is why companies employ the structure it's to incentivize people to stay and continue to grow the business right this protects the uh owner the tax thing it protects the employee the other piece that protects the employees that with phantom equity they're not liable right so if something happens in the business the employees are personally liable which is why this
(06:33) is a nice attractive thing for many people now this one is is something that's interesting i want to talk about which is profit right because a lot of times people conflate equity with profit you can be an equity owner and not participate in profit distributions you can also participate in profit distributions and not be an equity owner so these things are not connected oftentimes we think of them together because we as owners have both but it doesn't mean that our employees need that necessarily and i'm not saying
(06:58) you shouldn't do that i'm just saying it is yet another variable that is considered in the negotiation and so when i'm thinking through phantom equity most times it's going to depend on the value of the business but what i learned from the you know the mentors that i have spoken with typically when you're having a leadership type position who's a senior leadership so somebody who's like on the executive track they might get between half a percent to two percent depending again on the value of the business their
(07:23) seniority their experience etc and if you have a true executive that's a huge value add that is leading you know almost half the company etc then that is where you know sometimes three percent four percent five percent um can can come into play and so this is phantom equity there are lots of different types of you know you can do bonus programs you can do esops which is a story employee stock ownership programs there's lots of different things you can do in a business but this is one that i have used and has been very very
(07:51) helpful for me i've had people leave who had had equity and we've been able to be on good terms everything's been fine they were protected from a tax standpoint i tend to keep profit sharing not to say that it's bad or a good thing it's just my preference i love the fact that my employees can grow their well alongside me because they hear the same videos that you guys watch and then finally it's nice because they think in terms of a sale so they're thinking in terms of enterprise value so the more aligned i commit mike make my
(08:19) team and their life outcomes with my personal life outcomes then the more aligned will be and ultimately the faster we'll move in that direction because we're not you know pushing focus and effort in opposite directions we're all 100 aligned and so phantom equity is one of the best vehicles for that i hope you found value in this video you can click subscribe and if you're thinking about doing something like this um i'd recommend it i think that it's better to increase the size of the pie give a handful of slices out to people
(08:44) um who who've helped you along the way and i think that for me as i've shifted i really just want everyone to be wealthy heck there's a lot of people who are broke and the reason i made this channel is so that you're not one of them one of the best things that i can think of is helping the people who've helped me build this and so building my employees wealth is something that is my is something top of mind for me and trying to find new ways and creative ways to build wealth without necessarily sacrificing you know we've built and risked to get
(09:07) here so hope you found it valuable click subscribe and i'll see you guys next week bye

I Broke Down Every High Margin Service Into 6 Buckets [Delivery Cube] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Vv7rK-4Jc

Transcript:
(00:00) entrepreneurs and business owners my name is alex ramose and in the last four years we've done 120 million in sales across my four company i just want to share some of the lessons that have worked well for us in this time period so one of the questions we get is like how do i make more money right and a lot of times people think about acquisition stuff and sometimes it is acquisition based but the other half the equation is is making the customers more valuable all right one of the key ways of doing that is delivering more valuable
(00:24) services right and so services in general right you can think about this from a consulting basis you can do methods from a service page whatever right so this is not for physical product-based businesses it's for service type businesses all right and so what i want to walk you through is what i call the service delivery cube it's cubed because there's six sides you're gonna see the chart that i'm showing you right here is six but i'll walk through each one of them this is a creative process that i use when i'm thinking about how can i expand
(00:49) product lines what thing can i do with the existing resources that i have that can provide more value to my customers and you'd be amazed that if you walk through this cube so many opportunities will jump out at you using what you know excess capacity or or sawdust right so if you if you were if you had a lumber mill and all you do is you sell lumber there's all this sawdust that comes up on the ground and it's like how can we monetize the sawdust right we can we can make sandpaper out of it we can put it into pellets so that they can make
(01:14) pellet stoves right so how can we how can we use what we already have without incurring more cost and drive more value to our clients by repackaging the same thing and so this is called the service delivery cube all right so there's there's six components to this one is the ratio all right which is what's my client ratio for a service what if i wanted to do something one-on-one what if i want to do small group what if i want to do one-to-many all right one two unlimited amount so whatever i'm doing now i like to think
(01:43) about is there a way that i could do this one on one is there a way that i could do this in a small group is this way is there a way i could do this one to many right so this is the first kind of filter that i'll look any any service or potential other offering through the next is what extent is my client going to be involved is it going to be d do it yourself is going to be done with you right where we're going to help them implement you know a change of some kind or is going to be done for you his hands off
(02:09) they just pay us money and they get this result all right and so these are varying levels of value and service all right what's interesting about this one is that i i like there's another video i'll make it another time called the sales to fulfillment continuum but basically the the the harder the easier it is for you to fulfill the harder it tends to be to sell and so do it yourself is one of the hardest things to sell to someone because it's such low value because all of the efforts on them done with you is
(02:34) a little bit easier to sell because you have a little bit of an educational component so they feel like they're learning the skill right and it's a little easier for you to fulfill on and then finally the easiest thing to sell is done for you because someone just gives you money and they get the result and it's the shortcut right but this tends to be the most operationally complex there are you know billion dollar companies in each of these in each of these spaces they're just very on you know the more do-it-yourself it
(02:57) is the more of a marketing and acquisition company it is uh the more done for you it is many times these types of companies can provide such such value that people just come to them right and so that's the second of the service delivery cube the things that i'm looking at so i might already have one of these is there a way i could go up or down on this scale right the third is what i would consider support level all right and where they're going to get support all right so are they going to be supported in this process via text are
(03:25) they going to be supporting this process via chat there can be some process via email via via uh you know expert representative via phone via zoom what's the channel or channels that they're going to have access to me and my team all right excuse me the uh the fourth is going to be how do i want them to consume the information all right so if i'm going to have some sort of uh service delivery there's going to be some sort of onboarding process right do i want this to be live right do i want this to be recorded
(03:58) do i want this to be written right do i want this to be do i want this to be audio right like if you're listening on the podcast so i want to have like audio book versions of this do you want this to be video right and all of these things can be live or recorded so those are kind of the variations in terms of how i want them to consume right this is the consumption piece consumption consume the information right and so we're going through the service delivery cube so i'm thinking it what is what's the ratio and the thing
(04:24) is is all of these are a lot of variables and that's okay the point is that if you already have something you can look at where it fits on all six of these things and say can i move it one to the left or one to the right right and if you think about it that way you'll be able to excuse me a little tickle there be able to come up with a new product that might be more valuable and maybe even less cost to you right and that's what we're trying to find is i want to unearth where there's hidden value within my company using the existing resources i
(04:52) have that can drive more revenue and profit to the business all right the next is speed and convenience all right so one of my favorite sayings is that fast beats free and so if you look at you look at uber people could walk they take uber you look at fedex they could use u.s postal service but instead they pay more to get it overnight spotify there was free free music on the internet but it was a pain in the ass you know download all that stuff instead spotify came in and it was you could pay to not have the
(05:19) have the inconvenience right so speed in and of itself is something that people will pay for all right so is there a way that i can can i that i can cut the results in half the time is there that i can speed up my support so maybe i have normal support which is you know you get a repo apply at 24 hours but then i have vip support which is you get a response in 60 minutes or less right so it's all my existing resources but just put and repackaged in a different way with a different expectation for the client
(05:43) right and a lot of people will pay for that so that's an easy one that we can deliver value for all right so it's the fifth one and then the last one excuse me there's more of a mental exercise which i call the one 10x to 110. all right and this is a creative process that i like to think of which is if i were to 10x my price of this thing what else would i include right what else would i be willing to do right and on the flip side if the price of what i if i did was one-tenth if i if i had to fit it into one-tenth
(06:13) the price and i had to deliver more value than i am right now how would i do it and so there are two those are two creative questions from different ends of the scale so if i had a thousand dollar product for example if my thing was ten thousand dollars what would i be able to do that i'm not doing now right and a lot of times some of the creative ideas you have you could actually still do right now at these price points and figure out how to jam pack more value into your offering and on the flip side if i offered my product for 100 and
(06:40) i said i had to make it more valuable than it currently is what else would i include what else would i build into this thing right and so by thinking through though both of those processes i can usually come up with new ways to repackage my products and offerings and services uh to become more valuable all right so the service delivery cube the reason that i go through this is because i want to see how i can find excess capacity in my business to generate more revenue and profit without taking on more expenses reliability
(07:07) and i look at where my current products exist on this cube and think could i go one to the left or one of the right on any of these six so i'll same again from the top we've got the ratio of is it going to be 101 it's going to be small group is going to be one of many i've got what what level of effort are they going to be putting in is it do-it-yourself done with you or done for you right can i move either way to on this the third is going to be what level of support or what channels of support excuse me are the clients going to get
(07:31) are they going to get only only text are they going to get only phone calls are they going to get phone and call or can i have different levels based on these channels like we have our lower level which is just email and we've got a higher level which is phone and zoom right the fourth is gonna be how i want them to consume this do i want this to be a live experience or would be a recorded experience do i want this to be written audio or video how do i want them to consume information for me as a business fifth is how can i make this more
(07:55) convenient or less convenient how can i make this faster for them how can i increase the speed of communication with them right how can i deliver that in a way that's going to be in a very real way more valuable people pay for speed all right one of the easiest things in the entire world is look at any service category that exists and see if you can deliver the result in half the time just focus on that right i mean amazon prime think about it they they created an entire a movement you know with it they changed and transformed the entire
(08:21) e-commerce space simply by saying we're gonna get stuff to everyone in two days right now one day and now hours right and then finally the creative process of 10x to one tenth if i had if i if i were selling this for 10 times more than i am right now what would i include that i'm not and then can i include those in my current offering because i just didn't think about it and then if i had to deliver more value than i currently am and i was excuse me do this for one tenth of price what would i jim pack you to that thing
(08:48) and so this is the service delivery cube hopefully you found this valuable so i don't choke on myself from this tickle that i'm trying to keep down use this think through it and if you're if you're meeting with your team and thinking how can you provide more value this is one of the easiest cubes that i like to walk through so lots of love keep being awesome catch you on the flip side like subscribe comment tell me some questions uh and i will post some answers to them so keep it awesome catch you soon bye

The SIMPLE FORMULA that has DESTROYED BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSES - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) welcome to mozy nation in this video i'm going to be sharing with you the three most important lines that you need to draw in your business that you probably are not and i want to show you some different uh combinations of these lines and how dramatically it will impact how much money you make and ultimately the value of the company that you ultimately build so if you don't know my name is my name is alex from mozilla and acquisition.
(00:23) com we do about 85 million a year this is a rona sponsored episode so if i'm less chipper than normal that is why uh we thank our sponsors as always and so these are the three lines that i think everyone needs to understand all right so line number one right here i'm going to make sure that you guess so if you can guess right now which each of these lines are going to represent you have price you have value and you have cost of goods all right so every line has every business has these three lines within everything that they sell you have how
(00:53) much you sell it for you have how much value the person gets and you have what it costs you and what i want to show you is a mental framework and the interplay between these things and how dramatically it can shift your business so this is the value line this is what they are getting this is the price line this is how much you charge this is the cost of goods line which is how much it costs you to fulfill on this value right right okay so here's where it gets kind of cool if we move our price up see how little value we have here
(01:31) this means that we have a low customer surplus customer surplus is the excess between what they pay and what they get the higher the surplus the greater the distance between these two things here the more value they will perceive that they have gotten from your services the bigger this discrepancy is the more viral your business will be imagine there was a day years and years ago where you could have access to everything in the entire blockbuster store on demand from the comfort of your home and you could do it for less than it
(02:05) cost to do a new release and uh to rent a new release wouldn't that be amazing well they did create that and that was called netflix and so what they did was they priced it so low but their cost of goods was still lower because the cost of the incremental cost of adding a single customer was is basically nothing right and so their gross margins here is still very high because for them they can still lower these things even more and so what i'm telling you at the end of this video is that the trick to how you actually
(02:38) can build a fortune simply understanding the interplay between these three lines if i have one takeaway for everybody who's watching this is that if you can think about your business just using these three lines then you will be able to build a fortune if we have here our cost of goods at the bottom and we raise this all the way to here and we have a you know a ton of customer surplus what kind of business is this this is going to be a business that probably doesn't need to market very much this is going to be a business that is probably
(03:13) operationally difficult probably a service-based business and probably runs on very thin margins many businesses run like this these are a lot of old-school businesses that grow consistently every year by you know 10 15 per year and they don't have a ton of money to reinvest in resources they're very operationally efficient in order to run a business like this that's business scenario one let's see if you can guess what type of business this would be so this is mostly for generic mom-and-pop businesses decent margin let's say this
(03:44) is the baseline here sorry there's our baseline decent margins here decent margins decent value just kind of another run-of-the-mill business um nothing underwhelming or overwhelming about this business and this is what most small businesses operate like so let me tell you what type of business i would like to try and create my goal is always to find a way to provide something that's excessively valuable that cost me almost nothing to make unique expensive sticky air for those you know guys who know that channel it's
(04:17) one or one of that video it's one of my favorites i want something that costs almost nothing provides tremendous value and creates a big customer surplus and here's what's crazy the bigger you do this discrepancy the more viral your business will become for me as i feel like i've aged in entrepreneurial doggy years the more i strive for this than anything else because if you conquer this piece you conquer the customer surplus in terms of how much value they are getting for what they are paying then you will have an infinitely scalable
(04:52) business because you will have a quadratic way of expanding which is through word of mouth which is the antithesis of what everyone in the marketing world will tell you but the goal should always be to have a business that grows on word of mouth the problem is most people don't have enough word of mouth because this surplus is not big enough if you have the surplus big enough and you go from good to great and great to so good that people cannot help but tell their friends about you remarkable or remark worthy that is how good it is
(05:19) then you will have more customers than you know what to do with and your cost of acquisition will be zero and your your business will grow quadratically not linearly that is the difference between making money and building a fortune and i thought of this visual with the three lines and i just thought it was really telling and so i thought i would keep this short in the spirit of rona to show you this but if you can think through how you're providing value and really focus because the things that you can control you can
(05:45) control all three of these variables but when i'm trying to diagnose a problem that i want to solve as an entrepreneur i think how can i provide the most value step one step two how can i lower my cost of goods sold to a crazy degree and then once i know how i can lower my cost of goods sold to a crazy degree i'd rather have something that cost me a penny that i can sell for 10 cents that has the value of 10 and if you have that kind of value that you're able to deliver you will make a literal f ton of money and so i think
(06:18) this is a useful framework you can plot your own business you can probably plot your competitors business using this simple framework and i thought i would give it to you because it's one of the tools that i use when i'm thinking through how valuable an enterprise could potentially be and how i can move these lines around to create value create margin and ultimately take home the most money and help the most people just like everything that we do hopefully the price that you paid was the time the value that you got was
(06:45) hopefully a framework that you can use to apply to your business and the cost to get sold for me is the time that it takes me to do this and the the many failures and lessons i've learned and suffered the hard costs of failure to make these little uh frameworks for you so anyways moseynation i love you guys uh the reason i make this stuff is because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them keep being awesome if you enjoyed this hit subscribe if you didn't love either way catch you guys next video bye

How To Raise Your Prices [plus the letter I actually sent to customers] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy-RmpRif-I

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone in this video i'm going to show you how to raise your prices in a tactical way on your existing customers so it's one thing to raise your prices on new customers which for many times you know that's something that you have to do uh because you need to you know you want to reinvest in making the business better you want to cover some capital expenses or you just want to make more money which is fine and the number one lever on making money is what you're pricing at right we've done this in thousands of
(00:24) businesses now and there's a process that we go about this because if you raise it on existing customers be ready to have people be upset but here's why this is so important so let's say that your business runs at a twenty percent net margin which is fine right and let's say that you just for number sake you charge a hundred dollars a month if you're running a twenty percent net margin and you're 100 a month a 20 increase in pricing would double your profit a 50 increase in pricing with three and a half extra profit
(00:49) that's pretty good if you doubled your price you would 6x how much money you make and so this is how big of a lever pricing is on how much profit you make and so knowing how to raise your prices obviously would be something that would be very important so there is a right way and a wrong way to do it so what i want to do is show you the right way because the wrong way to do is send an email out saying hey we're raising our prices you know screw you um and you'll get a ton of customers who leave you and then you'll end up being
(01:12) worse off than you were before but i did this in my facility this is one of my first businesses and i actually had a third of my customers cancel but i tripled my price and so i was able to keep two thirds of my customers at three times the price and lose one third of my biggest my employees called it the culling we got rid of all the problem customers in one fell swoop so if you have a pain a bunch of customers were always complaining about stuff you might want to do this because you'll get rid of all the cancerous people and keep only the
(01:36) people who love you and when i did that i doubled my revenue and here's what's even cooler my profit went through the roof because i even had to service a third fewer customers which was awesome all right and so the way that we do this is uh through a price increase letter and if you're curious um my gymloc secrets book is a book that is about gyms but is a business book that is simply applied to gyms if you want it you can grab it it is not how i make money um but let's say let's let's walk through this so you have your letter to increase prices
(02:04) right now there's a format to doing this all right now it's not about you it's about the prospect it's about the consumer all right so the first thing that we want to do right is you know we're gonna say hey you've probably known that we've been you know growing a lot you've probably noticed a lot of the the good things that are going on right now um and so that's why i'm writing this letter all right so it's like why am i doing this why am i writing this letter to you what's the intention the letter all right the second is we're going to
(02:27) talk about what we currently are doing all right and so this is allowing you to re resell them a little bit on what you're currently doing the value you're currently providing them because sometimes they forget because they might only use one aspect of your service and so if they're like oh wow there's a lot of extra stuff that i didn't even know about and believe me i can't even tell you the amount of times people read this letter and they're like i didn't even know you were doing all this stuff right and so you want to list
(02:48) out you know the stuff that you're doing and say okay you know we hire and retain the best talent you know we have we offer continued education for our employees we you know we we're providing new uh softwares and equipment uh to our members that that we always try and keep up to date that's what we're currently doing they're like oh i didn't even think about that so the goal here is to is to get them to think about your costs try and get them into the mind of you as an entrepreneur to the best of your you know ability right like these are the
(03:14) things that we incur in order to provide this value it's not like we're just taking all the money you give us and putting it in our pockets because that's what everyone always thinks all right the next thing we do is we say wow despite all the stuff that we're doing we want to do even more because we're losing our minds because we just provide crazy value all right and so it's like we want to um like you know we're currently a ragtag bunch of champions our our our facility if you have an actual facility and if you're online it's like you know
(03:39) we've got a lot of stuff that's duct taped together we want to really uh you know level up the brand and we want to do it for you right so you want to tell them what's coming so this is like we want to add these x y and z things we want to add specialty programs we can add higher levels of service we want to add you know events to our to our business we want to add all these things right a massive improvement to our level of service these are all things that we want to be adding right and then what i like to do is i like to
(04:03) tie this tie this increase to a promise of values okay now what i mean by that is i want to tie this to values that i ascribe to that no one can contest so i can say i have made this promise to you and with integrity i can no longer provide the level of service uh that i have promised unless we do these things because i will not stand here in this marketplace and say that we are the best at xyz unless we do these things and the only way for me to do these things is for us to have a corresponding increase in price all right now mind you
(04:36) when you're communicating the price it's also important to communicate the price in a way that's you know attractive so you want to say hey it's going to cost you five thousand dollars extra a year you would say it'd be better to say uh it's going to cost you an extra 100 bucks a week right sounds like a lot less right you could even break down even more and say it's 15 bucks a day it depends on you know who we're talking to and what level of service you have but you can break it down to weekly or break it down to daily and that's why
(04:57) insurance quotes people in days it's only a dollar a day right um so that you can do this and it will minimize what the perceived cost is so ideally you want to maximize by saying this is all the stuff we're doing that we you didn't even know about this is the stuff we want to do that's even more than that and this is how little it's going to cost you and the reason we must do this is so that i can maintain my integrity to you and the promise that i've made you i'm fervid that this is something i'm planning my flag here is that i demand
(05:23) to be the best in the marketplace and for us to do this we must continually invest and for us to do that like this is what is required right and then and here's what's cool is that i like to add a little ps at the end and that little ps is to give perspective all right and what i do here is i say if this is going to materially affect your life if you're not going to be able to pay your mortgage you're not going to be able to buy groceries for your kids please reach out to me um and we can figure something out and
(05:48) so by saying that you automatically perspective to everyone that listen no one's gonna go homeless over this thing right no one's gonna lose their house because we're raising the price of our xyz right right but we open the door for discussion for the people who feel obligated or feel the need to do this now if you make an announcement like this which i recommend you doing via video and via direct mail you want to make it and then also turn the comments off on whatever the post is because believe me you don't want to deal with that as you
(06:13) just say hey i don't want this to be you know a gossip form if you have anything just bring it through me directly out of respect for you i want to deal with these you know face to face and not over the keyboard right and so it's an easier way to also manage and mitigate any kind of negativity that happens and believe me if you raise your prices you're going to have people who are going to be squeaky wheels and it's in their best interest to get you to not raise the prices so just don't chicken out once you commit to it stick with it all
(06:36) right because i'm telling you if you raise your price like i just told you if you have a 25 margin and you raise your price by 25 you double your profit all right so i told you i lost a third of my customers but that's because i tripled my price and most businesses don't realize how much of a pain it is to find another one of your business and so if you can capitalize on that and you can usually eke out an increase in in revenue and profit as a result you will be far out rewarded by making that change and the people who do leave
(07:03) are usually your worst customers and you've been wanting to get rid of them anyways and this gives you a great time to do it so if you're going to raise your prices this is the way that i do it to existing customers i write a letter i tell them you know why i'm set i'm setting the stage for why we're doing this i tell them all the things that we're currently doing that they don't know that we're doing and you probably do tons of stuff it's good to list the stuff out then you tell them about the future of what's going to
(07:23) happen what the benefits are going to be to them to what they're about to enjoy and how that's going to impact them in a real way in every single time they see you they experience your business they interact with you and what benefit of the benefit is going to occur and then finally i like to end with values and perspective all right so probably values are right here so values is kind of the wrap up so just consider that 3.
(07:45) 5 sorry 3.5 right and then you have your wrap up which is hey big picture this isn't going to make you or break you you're not going to go homeless because of this but if you do have something that's going to materially affect you because you have that anchor it makes it very easy for you to have that discussion right and so if you have to raise your prices this is how i recommend doing it i actually have the exact letter that we send out for for gyms in my book if you want to grab it you can i promise you it's not how i make my
(08:08) dollars but you can get that alex's book.com if you're curious otherwise keep being amazing um keep being awesome i made this channel so that uh a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them that's why i made this so keep being awesome i'll see you guys on flipside bye

Pricing Lessons From a Private Equity God - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnfh2jqNVEQ

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on everyone hope you're having a wacky wednesday um i am fired up today i'm gonna probably make a bunch of content because i've had like 10 straight days of events and i have all these questions that people were asking me on my mind and little anecdotes that i shared that people found value in so hopefully you don't mind me just sharing those things with you now so um the first uh two days were actually events that we attended and spoke at uh which is at sas academy dan martel's event and i was fortunate enough to be at the
(00:25) speakers table which was value in and of itself and one of the people who was at the speakers table with me was a man named marcus rivera he was vista's former head of pricing packaging and products so pretty much when they would acquire a company he would be the guy that would go in and retool the entire kind of fulfillment structure who they were serving how they would break down you know the the levels of membership etc and so for those who don't know what vista is vista is uh i think the world's largest private equity
(00:55) firm for software um if you put their whole portfolio together it's over 50 they do over 50 billion a year um they would be ranked third i think um in the world uh behind like facebook and amazon so like uh for like software companies so they're um they're really really big really really smart and uh i was fortunate enough to sit next to this guy for uh two days which was awesome for me um and one thing became really clear when we were having dinner um and so they have something called vsops which is vista's um
(01:24) uh sop so they're they're kind of their standard operating procedures and these things are so closely guarded you need like retinal scans and like there's like you only get access to certain numbers of them if you're at certain levels and then they you your access gets removed it's like super top secret stuff and this is literally how they create value how they purchase companies put their system on top and then increase the value of that company and so for them their whole mantra is tripling their money in three years so
(01:50) it's three and three and so um one of the things that he shared with me now obviously he couldn't share like the the intricacies but the concept was really really powerful for me and i'll tell you how we applied it at gymlodge and so um one of the things that uh most companies don't do is they don't score their leads right they don't score their prospects they don't score their customers based on uh the value of that customer right and so scoring them can be based on a number of of characteristics behaviors etc that that person shows uh
(02:24) to you know put them in a certain bucket right and uh what vista does and what they count on is the fact that when they go into a company when they're assessing a company in the diligence process that they're going to learn more about that company that the founder and the people in that company even know about it and so what they do is they parse out the data and they start trying to find the veins or the buckets of the most valuable customers once they find those buckets that vein of customers that's more valuable what they then do is they
(02:50) basically expand and focus on that vein of high ltv customers like it sounds simple and one of the things that marcos actually hit on a lot was like he's like we we stick to simple simple systems simple processes and so when when we when i've like said things like the people who are the most advanced never don't do the fundamentals i feel like i've seen this at like so many levels and seeing this from probably you know the biggest and probably biggest you know software turnaround increasing value company out there um is pretty
(03:17) cool and so let me tell you what we did um to kind of go through this process and so marcos was explaining that they don't even just do it for customers they do it for uh prospects opportunities and uh and customers so three different segments they're going to look and score at each each part of the pipeline all right using the analytics that they have in the teams that they do now you're like okay cool that's awesome alex how does this make more money at my gym and so let me tell you how we're applying it right now and so what we did um is we
(03:48) took the last 90 days i think it was july uh july august september or maybe it was september i think yeah i think it was july august september so it's like a 90-day block of time and we looked at all of our exits all of our escalations uh what the with the people who kind of kind of sucked the most are people who didn't get the most results whatever you want to put it uh the people were the the hardest to serve uh and who got the least results using our program and then we looked at the the conversation the reverse of that what were the
(04:18) characteristics of the people who made the most money who got the highest returns who were the easiest to work with right and so we found here's some unsurprising facts um if you are not a gym owner right uh you don't do as well as people who are gym owners crazy crazy facts right um and we also learned that if you're not full-time in your gym and you have a job outside and you're trying to do a gym as a side hustle or something you don't do as well as people who are fully committed to their gym if you don't have a signed lease or a
(04:49) building of your own you don't do as well as someone who has a building of their own right and if you uh don't have any employees it's harder for you to do this mostly because there's a huge time constraint right like it takes effort to implement new systems because not only do you have to keep your existing business going you have to start working on top of that in order to dig yourself out of the hole right and so when we found those characteristics what we started doing is we started uh uh filtering and qualifying our front end
(05:14) and so we started doing this uh for the month of october all right so we we took the 90 days we found we took the findings and then we implemented for the month of october right now we're in november and what's crazy is this from the the previous four weeks so in september the last four weeks compared to after we started doing this qualification there's two crazy two crazy numbers i'm going to share with you one is once we qualify prospects that they had to have at least 25 clients they had to have assigned lease they had to be a
(05:44) full-time gym owner right and ideally this was optional but ideally have one employee or more who worked with them so that they could share the load and so that they could actually focus more on selling and you know working leads etc when we looked at the after effect of that our sales decreased from uh over 100 a month uh in terms of gyms to about 40 to 50 right now here's where it gets interesting all right so that cut our inflow in half by qualifying our customers right by by really making sure that the people were coming in were the
(06:15) best fit who could serve the best right here's what's cool on our side now that we've done this in the first four weeks in the four week period since then the people who started after those qualifications we've had zero escalations from those people prior to that we have we had 22 escalations as in people who were having issues uh you know whatever it is you know i mean just red flags right um the the prior four weeks so from 22 to zero now think how crazy this is in terms of scaling a business and operational uh complexity as you go up
(06:55) right so we we had this huge vein of people who were taking up the vast majority of my team's time and were actually worth less right they made less they were worth less to us and so when you're thinking about scaling and maintaining operational efficiency and profit if you're looking at the customers that that are the highest lifetime value the best customers right and here's what's crazy the people so after that october date um we switched back to the define in program which is what we did for you know three years so we did a a brief
(07:28) stint where we uh where we basically signed people up for a year up front because we wanted to give them everything it was it was a trial we did a 90-day sprint and uh it turned out that that didn't work nearly as well as having defined it and it's kind of the same way you run the gyms it's like having a defined end program tends to be a little bit more it's a little bit easier for people to wrap their heads around a little more defined in terms of the skills that they need to acquire etc but what's interesting is that the
(07:49) people who uh came back in were actually paying more than the the people who uh were paying more than the people who who we were letting before so this this new vein of customer who's higher qualified is paying more is making more requires less work now that sounds like a recipe for a higher profit business right it also sounds like a recipe for better happier customers and so also what happens if you think about it from a reputation standpoint it's like you're if you if you lower the bar too much then what happens is you bring in people who are
(08:23) not qualified right they take up more of your team's time they cost you tons of effort and they're not making as much which means that then they say like your thing is not as good right when in reality it might just not be as good for them right which makes sense i mean like it makes intuitive sense and so i just like sharing these these mistakes learns with you so that maybe i can look back on this 10 years from now and be like hey i remember when we started doing that um but now what our focus is is cool we
(08:51) know who the best customers for us are and it's like dear god why did this take us three years to do this you know like you know learn from my stupidity like hopefully you can start doing this with your own stuff and now we're just gonna focus and double down on that vein of customers and try to expand that by really focusing on on them in multiple platforms right and so um i say this is to say if vista has has repeatedly you know been able to go from i mean they're not a super old firm you know from basically nothing all the way
(09:21) to 50 billion in a very short period of time it's because they know how to extract and amplify value and the biggest thing is not change i mean they do shirt they tweak the pricing they find the right buckets etc but they do that by analyzing the customers better than the business that they're purchasing purchasing even knows their own customers and so i challenge you now this may sound like super analytical it's not all you have to do is look over the last three months okay look at the people who left your business all right
(09:50) this is where you get the the best data is from all the people who leave right so look at the data from people who left your business try and get as like to think about as many character traits as you possibly can what's their age what's their you know what's their job uh what are their goals what do they sign up for how much money down did they start with um what do they sign up for in terms of their continuity etc and if you can if you can piece those things together then you're gonna get a really good idea of of uh of
(10:20) who the good customers are and who the bad customers are and it's okay to have a stern line because we're doing this now now the thing is is like in the in the short term you can be like oh my gosh my inflow cut in half but so did all my operational overhead and and the issues that like all that work that the team had to put together um to try and service these people who were not necessarily the best fit right and so um i share that with you and i'll give you one more tidbit that i learned from him and so uh we learned this from
(10:49) the from the whole event which we took is a huge takeaway for us that you can totally apply to your gym is that customers in a recurring base business or really any business decide whether they're going to stay at two points in the beginning of your life cycle all right between the sale and when they start getting the thing right the service the product the whatever and once they start using the product the implementation or onboarding period so in that period so if you're doing an orientation with your clients right they
(11:22) buy something all right the time between the purchase and when they start getting the thing which would be your orientation and the actual orientation itself is typically when people are already making the decision of when they want whether they're going to stay with you in the long run all right which means if right now you just think your your orientation is an aftermath it's like oh yeah now we have to fulfill that thing we sold you're screwed right you're getting by just on the fact that like you're you have enough volume in the
(11:51) door but you're losing massive amounts of money by not making that a completely choreographed experience that you're really focusing on over delivering a value and the way to do that is to demonstrate the skills that they're going to need to be able to use to use your services right and so whether that like they not just not just saying hey yeah you should download this app yeah yeah you'll figure it out but actually doing it with them holding their hand and then having them duplicate the process so that you can see that you've
(12:22) transferred the skill to them so that they now know and they are self-sufficient in being able to consume your services right and so if your onboarding is rushed right your orientation is rushed then expand the time period because it's going to massively multiply the lifetime value of that customer and the likelihood that they're going to stay with you so this is one of those few times where you don't want to be lazy and not and not deliberate and intentional in how you're onboarding the customer after you complete the sale so
(12:53) the communication that you have with them immediately after the sale which is like sending them a personalized video you know giving them swag maybe a letter whatever it is definitely texting them between the time that they make the sale or you make the sale and when they start the onboarding and the second piece i'm already going back to the big beginning is the sale itself and so what we're learning internally for us at gym launch and this may seem obvious but maybe i'm sharing it with you because we're learning it
(13:17) too is that expectations are everything right expectations are everything and if you set proper expectations for what is going to happen next and then you fulfill that beautifully your trust with the prospect goes up now here's where it can get uh tricky right and this is what we call selling hot it's where you where you set expectations so high it's impossible for you to ever fulfill or for you to hit that with the majority of customers right and so this is where selling towards behavior and selling towards sustainability and
(13:51) long-term change comes really into play so that you can shift and break the beliefs of your prospect to shifting their time frame to what is really going to be beneficial for them rather than um simply trying to sell them to say yes right and so um an example of this is you know for us if if someone has only consumed testimonial and we've we've changed this in our marketing we've changed this in our testimonials we've changed it in the in the post that we tag people in is that we're really no longer focused on on saying like hey
(14:22) look at these 10 people who made a hundred grand in their first you know six weeks with us right we have those right we totally do but the thing is is like but what are the averages right and so now we just share what the average gym does all right and it's significantly less you know appealing i think the average gym right now is like they do 16 000 in their first six weeks with us right now that's a lot but it's not a hundred grand in your first month and and showing what the average gyms are getting in terms of leak costs and
(14:51) lead flow gives people at least an average understanding and we can explain to the person that means that half the people who sign up get less than this right this is the average and so that way um if you if and when you do go above that mark then their expectations are reasonable and you can over deliver right um and in an ideal world you would probably try and sell on the bottom 25 of results so that the expectations are so low that everyone is excited about the fact that they're over achieving from that um from
(15:26) that baseline that you have set for them and so what i've like i'm continuing to learn this i like want to write like a whole presentation on expectations but expectation management is everything right it's amazing what happens if you set a really high expectations and like this is where this is where someone makes twenty thousand dollars in their first month and is disappointed with gym launch and we've had this happen plenty of times right they're like well this sucks i thought i was gonna do better right when in reality
(15:55) that's [ __ ] amazing right um in terms of the big scheme now maybe this resonates with you because you've had someone who loses five pounds in their first 14 days with you and they're disappointed now why would they be disappointed only one reason because the expectations that were set for them in the sale and in the orientation were were too high for the average person and then most people are disappointed with what would otherwise be considered an amazing great start and so if you can reset the expectations
(16:27) that are being uh put on the customer in the sale right and you sell around the fact uh not around yourself through the fact and you break the belief around what the explanation should be in a short and long-term vision so that you can shift their expectations towards long-term change and a process and behavior change so that they can ultimately achieve what they want which is being fit forever not fit for the next six weeks or six months right and so um all that to say the big takeaways that we have at gym launch is that we
(16:54) are now heavily qualifying people on the front end so that we have longer lifetime value we have superior client outcomes we have less operational complexity because these people have the right characteristics of people who are successful both externally in terms of like what they have their gym but internally in terms of how they work um and how like what level of effort they're willing to put in to be successful right we found out that entrepreneurs are not a very good uh demographic for us and so it's like cool
(17:22) we're not going to service them right we're not going to service them in this way maybe we'll create an info product that's um less for them so that they can go through it at their own leisure or their own time frame rather than the intense time frame that we uh put on to people uh when they start gym launch because it's really like ready fire go you know you have 72 hours and leads are starting to come in right and that's how we do things in gym much because that's how i am right um but we have now used this on the
(17:49) qualification side and then also how our sales people are tagging and setting expectations and then being extremely deliberate and we're still working on this um in making the onboarding and implementation even more choreographed and we have a pretty darn choreographed orientation process but even better even even more reinforced even simpler so that the handoff is seamless so that everyone knows exactly what is going to happen before it happens and then they know exactly what is going to happen next uh in their experience with us and
(18:18) so you can use this all these these lessons that we're learning right now um in your business so that you can increase the quality of the customer set the expectations properly and then over deliver on the expectations that you've set so that they can make the decision in the first two or three meetings with you that they're gonna stick with you for the long haul so i hope this is valuable for you like it uh drop a drop a comment drop a review if you're listening this on the podcast um and uh as usual if you uh want some free

All Entrepreneurs Have Only 1 Problem... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) all right in this video what i want to talk about is um i just finished our strategic meeting and it was so apparent um some of the new talent that we brought in um how much they were really driving growth in um in some of our companies and i want to talk about this because i think it's the single hardest thing that entrepreneurs face like every single entrepreneur has one problem they think they have multiple problems but they have one problem and it's a people problem they don't know where to find good people
(00:25) number one number two they don't know how to hire and recruit those people number three if they don't know how to manage those people number four they know how to grow uh and cultivate the talent right and so that entire process embodies what really growing a business becomes after you get to probably about 10 10 to 30 million a year is when when ops really really start taking over especially at 30 it's all about talent and i think i've said this before this is probably the big it's been the biggest bottleneck for me crossing 30 to 100
(00:55) um is was really understanding that it was understanding that it was all about the talent it's actually not about you and that can be really hard for your ego because you love being needed and that's like an interpersonal need that we you know have from childhood or whatever it is we didn't get hugged enough but like that need is something that is outside of the business the business doesn't require you the business should be able to run on its own and this is something that has shifted over time um that being said it doesn't mean that
(01:19) you can't have the strategic vision for the business you know bezos just stepped down for the first time after you know 30 years or whatever um but but you're the actual doing the leading all that stuff over time the company becomes a company of companies right it becomes a conglomerate as you grow and so what i want to talk about specifically today is how to find and know the difference between an a player and a b player or really an a player and everyone else and i can't really stress how unbelievably important this is and the
(01:49) thing is is that we've talked to entrepreneurs they're always like my team's awesome and you talk the same entrepreneur a year later and they're like that team was horrible this team's awesome and that's because we're eternal optimists right that's that's just the reality of it if you can't look at someone on your team and be like i think this person's kind of weak or i think this person could be better um then you really have rose-colored glasses on right and that's the hard part and i honestly this isn't this
(02:10) wasn't real for me until i actually saw teammates of mine growing divisions of our companies without me doing it in ways that i had never thought of once that happened it became real for me i think there's these different steps in your entrepreneurial journey i mean the first one was when i remember the first person who did a sale for me i cried i remember i cried because i heard about on the phone and they're like yeah i sold two people today and i i had done every single sale for my business for like a year and a half it's just it was
(02:39) just no one could bring it in right and and the answer is other people can bring it in you're not special um but i it wasn't real for me and as soon as this this girl did this i was like oh my god like i don't have to i don't have to literally make the money someone else can do this and i can actually start running the business and so it's a huge breakthrough um and there's obviously levels to this right and i think the the level that i just recently had a breakthrough on was watching teammates actually grow the
(03:07) business um without me right and it's really special it's really awesome so you're like that's awesome for you alex why are you talking to me great question a players and b players so what i want to do is tell you a quick story because i think it's perfect for illustration so we just recently promoted a brand manager one of our companies and she was given uh the task of like hey why don't you think about other revenue streams that we could possibly bring into the company and so she said i thought we should start an apparel line because i'm
(03:36) getting lots of messages on social media about how we should have apparel um and i think that'd be a good opportunity and so her her supervisor said i think that's a great idea go for it right and so what she did was she emailed you know 20 different uh you know manufacturing companies uh for for apparel um she got samples from all of them she tried them all on she felt them and she showed up to the strategic meeting and she was like they were crap she was like i'm not sending that to my customers she said those exact words and i can't
(04:07) tell you what it felt like for me as an owner to hear that she said i'm not sending that to my customers and it was because it showed so much ownership and one of our core tenants is bureau and boss which i'm switching to act like an owner but that's exactly what she did and to push it even further she didn't just stop there and say all this stuff sucks because that would just be presenting a problem instead she was like but i did find some manufacturers that don't do manufacturing and fulfillment because some centers do both
(04:33) which is much more convenient for me as a business but she's like but their stuff is legit it's awesome just like so i just need help figuring out how how many pieces do you want to order as a baseline i'll figure out the logistics to get to a third-party fulfillment center so that we can do this apparel launch and so we ended up coming with a solution for it and she felt great about it we looked at different you know designs and uh and with with the great quality we were able to come up with a solution but here's here's what i want to bring a
(04:58) break apart for you imagine a normal person a b b level employee nothing wrong with them there's lots of them right but they show up they do their job they go home right they don't take ownership because what what an alternative story of what would have happened is the director says hey why don't you look for new revenue opportunities and that person may or may not have done at level one right level two they actually do it and they say i think apparel she says okay go check out apparel now what that person probably would have done
(05:28) was look at three companies from a google search maybe or maybe not even sample the product just look at the pricing and say hey i found an apparel company we can print our logo on it we can ship it out that is what a b player would have done and honestly unless you have an a supervisor the a supervisor probably would have let it go and what and i'll tell you the difference the difference is with the a scenario you have a high quality product that people buy enjoy and buy again and that massively increases the ltv of the customer
(06:02) and on top of that that brand manager cares deeply about the customers and their experience and she's going to be thinking top of mind how do i make this easier how do i make this faster how can i improve their experience right whereas the b player you already lost them like oh yeah they don't like the t-shirts i mean what do they expect right i mean like they're 30 t-shirts i mean they're not gonna be you know xyz and so that difference is the game and finding people who think like that a player compared to people who think like the b
(06:37) player is the difference between companies that grow and companies that die companies that barely compete and make it and companies that thrive and none of what i just described was earth shattering it was just a willingness to do more work and raising the bar it was having a level of intolerance for anything but excellence and it is my belief that within a company hierarchy every person the higher the person who runs the division or the department or the company should always have the lowest amount of tolerance for anything but excellence
(07:13) which means you should be intolerant of anything that is not amazing right and that trickles down it gets deluded right at every level it's diluted a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more and if there comes a day where you see two people and you see a supervisor and you see someone underneath that supervisor and the person underneath has a has a lower tolerance for anything but excellence than their supervisor those roles should reverse the person who cares the most should be the one in charge and so if there comes a day where
(07:42) someone cares more about my customers and the experience and the business that we have than i do they should rightfully run the company not me and sometimes entrepreneurs get to that point they have a ceo and they elect them because they're like i think that you're better equipped for this and i think that you care more deeply and that's okay that happens right you know phil knight doesn't run nike anymore but um i mean shoot jeff bezos says and you obviously step down for other reasons and what not but the big picture here is having
(08:07) a level of intolerance for what an a versus a b looks like starts with us and the thing is is whoever you hire most people only hire people worse than them and so if you're if you're one level removed or two levels removed dear god imagine what you're what's what's being hired on the front line right and so you have to carry this torch you have to raise this bar you have to set the standard so that a players will be attracted to you and also so that you can have a team of a players and then the entire culture rises
(08:37) right if you've ever been on a winning team a championship team you know the difference between the vibe how people come to practice how they play the expectations of one another right the speed of response the teamwork all of that that's culture and that's only created through having the right players on the field the right people on the bus and kicking off the wrong people and i'll end with this quote from the head of people for chick-fil-a which is a company i admire a lot she said a lot of companies want to compete against us
(09:08) in the championship but the reality is they lost in the draft and that one really resonated with me because and i'm paraphrasing here that might not even be your title but that was what she said in general and that that really struck me because so many of us are always trying to develop or awesome develop talent i was trying to do all these things management styles etc but some people just come with batteries included there are some people who are just winners right and you just need to get out of their way and i think that it's worth
(09:37) the extra five interviews it's worth the extra 20 interviews to find the a player because once that person is in place they will grow right they will grow whatever they touch and this has been a deep lesson for me which is what you know people are like it's all about people and it is it's just boring and unsexy for most entrepreneurs because we love the promotion we love the sales we love the marketing we love all that stuff right we love the product but the people is what runs it and i think that this has been this has
(10:04) been a deep lesson for me um and i hope i hope if you look at your team right now you don't think oh they're all amazing right because the reality is they're probably not right um and every single entrepreneur says that i can tell you right now some people that are weak on our team right but you have to be honest about it and you have to think not just what are they doing but what would i be doing in their position what initiative would i be taking that they're not taking what questions would i be asking that they are not asking and
(10:32) ideally you want someone who's asking questions that you haven't thought of and that's when you know you've got an a player so anyways this comes with time it comes with experience it comes with once you've seen an a player you can never unsee them and then you start to use that template to apply to other people all right and so and then you repeat it over and over again and i think that's why entrepreneurship takes time like you grow you grow in levels you grow intolerance you grow an interpersonal understanding you grow an
(10:56) awareness of other people and by as you grow in that awareness so too will your selection of talent so too will your recruitment of talent um your management and growth of those people so anyways hope that made sense hope that was valuable for you if you're hiring people only look for eight players put in the extra time to get the a player because it will pay you dividends beyond your wildest dreams and there was a harvard study that showed that eight players are worth five times more than b players and with that i'll catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to show you the seven ways to measure business value and how you're probably being deceived by most people you see on the internet simply because you're not understanding the words and terms they're using all right so by the end of this video you'll understand who's bs who's legit who's real who's fake and if they haven't given you enough information to make the decision exactly what questions to ask all right so let's dive in so the first of the seven types of ways that people will measure value
(00:28) is that they will extrapolate a single month of contract value into eternity or at least over a year example what that looks like is someone you know selling a yearly contract at an event they sell a hundred people at that event let's say uh for thirty thousand dollars a year and they say we're doing three million dollars a month right crazy but the reality is they sold three million dollars of contracts that are unenforceable to people on monthly uh income streams or monthly cash flow and so a hundred people at twenty five
(00:58) hundred dollars a month is what will get you to that thirty thousand dollars right roughly what that really means is they did two hundred fifty thousand dollars at that event but they said i'm doing three million dollars a month right even though it was a one-time event that is not going to recur and they based it on contra value contract value and not payments collected and so the first way to see through this stuff is to say well how much money was actually collected and how reliable are the contracts that you're
(01:24) actually selling if you have highly uh you know secured contracts with companies that are legit or you have them secured against assets meaning that the likelihood that they continue is high or you have a net negative churn company meaning the contract increases in value over time based on the business economics that you have like salesforce for example when you sign a contract with salesforce you sound a contract with hubspot which is another crm most of those clients increase how much they spend over time and so that would
(01:48) be legit in that instance but the vast majority of people who are saying this to you are not being legit and so first thing to look out for at the very end i'll give you my rating for each of these ways of doing it all right the second is lifetime revenue so this is when someone says we've done x amount of total revenue collected in our business now a lot of times we'll say i have a i mean i see an ad right now that i run all the time it's like how i built a 50 million dollar business but they mean how much revenue they've
(02:15) collected over the lifetime of the business and so for context of how ridiculously inflated this will be mcdonald's employee will collect a million dollars in revenue as income is honestly that's even better because it's income it's not even revenue but like just to show you how ridiculous and preposterous this is a mcdonald's employee will collect that over the entire lifetime if you work to mcdonald's your whole life right and so if you if you use this metric then it's incredibly inflating and it's great for your ego and it
(02:39) sounds good to impress people who don't know what you're talking about okay and so you may have seen one of my videos that said 122 million in revenue uh for for me and i do that a because the headline is more compelling than saying you know we've done mid-30s for the last three or four years you know i'll play the game too but understanding what that comes from and so that's why i try and be as honest as possible like well this is what we did in revenue this is what we did in profit so that i can just be transparent with
(03:02) everybody so you know at least what to look for and so when someone says we have a 50 million business or 100 million dollar business ask them are you talking about yearly revenue are you talking about profit like what are you talking about specifically when you say that number right and a lot of times we're like well i i meant i guess that's how much you know total revenue we've done you know since we started now mind you most entrepreneurs especially newer entrepreneurs will conflate they will mix revenue with cash
(03:28) collected right those are two very different things right revenues is is contract value right but cash collected is really reality and so they'll use this term and for the purpose of this video when i say revenue i mean cash collected what was processed and received by the business so the second way that people describe their values how much total revenue they've done in their lifetime so you may actually have seen you can see this award counter over here i got for doing 100 million or passing 100 million in total revenue in three years three
(03:57) and a half years i think since we started with clickfunnels which is a software that we use for landing pages and they recognize the people who are top performers but again that's revenue like it doesn't mean it means cash collected but it that doesn't mean that like we're doing that per year now this year is a breakout year and i'll tell you what we do at the end of this year because we will be close to that number um i don't think we'll cross 100 million this year but um we're we'll be really close number three
(04:21) is business valuation so this one is one where it's based on the market's value of the business if it were sold so this is another way of kind of inflating the the business that you have now this isn't necessarily an unfair way of valuing your business right based on its own value but the thing is it all depends on who's the one who's ascribing the value what are they what are they using to create that value i hear all the time like i think i'd be able to get 15 times top line you don't know squat right the market will pay what the
(04:50) market will pay all right and so for most businesses that are small businesses so anything that's under 5 million dollars a year in revenue most of those guys are getting two to three times ebitda which is another measurement i'm gonna get to in a second which is the earnings before interest tax amortization and depreciation right and so those are business metrics uh that is going to have a multiple scribe to it so if you're a mid market which would be like 10 to 100 million dollars in revenue per year then you might have a six to eight times
(05:17) multiple if you get above 100 million dollars then a lot of times you can get into the you know 12s 15s etc and most of the time that's done on ebitda in a very very very rare number of circumstances will they do it on top line revenue all right and that is in a fast growth company that has high amounts of capital that need to be reinvested in it that they believe are going to give it a strategic advantage for high gross profits in the future um that they're reinvesting capital into all right and so that's where you know i
(05:43) saw somebody recently saying that they had you know they stole their business for a hundred times ebitda right what that really means is that like and this is where this is what i want everybody to watch this video to be thinking well either they had a really really crazy business or more likely they were making almost no profit in their business and just got a high valuation because of or not even necessarily a high valuation if they if they're doing a you know 10 000 a year in profit on a five million dollar
(06:06) business then if they sell for you know five million dollars they get 500 times ebitda which is ridiculous right but people do that because it sounds impressive right so that's why we're that's why we're going through this so you can cut through the bs and hopefully get better sources of information which is kind of my goal here is that you can measure you can measure other entrepreneurs value based on the true value that they've been providing all right so the next one here is yearly revenue all right so this is how much revenue a business
(06:31) is doing yearly now we're getting a little bit closer to reality here now again revenue versus cash collected it depends on the type of business if you have a service business that's based on recurring revenue and contracts then you're gonna have contracts that are factored into that if you had an e-commerce business for example which is purely transactional then the revenue and cash collector can be very close to each other right and you know revenue would also not take into account refunds chargebacks things
(06:51) like that which then gets into net revenue i won't get into it there's a zillion terms and just as a side note here the reason there are so many terms is because measuring value is something that is one of the hardest aspects of investing in business in general is that people want to figure out what is this thing worth and so that's why they have lots of different metrics that look at and so for you as a as a as a keen you know entrepreneur or investor or you know person who wants to grow within the business world understanding all of
(07:15) these metrics and how they work together to to assess or get as close to true value as possible are these are going to be tools in your in your skill set and some of these are better and some of these are worse and i'll get to my ratings in a second all right so yearly revenue is the next which is just how much are you doing every year in terms of top line right now the next one is profit or ebitda now these two things are not necessarily the same um but i'm going to say ebitda being earnings before interest tax
(07:39) depreciation and mortization right um for most businesses this is where coming back to the business valuation if you're mid market you're getting six to eight if you're kind of smaller then you're at you know two to three sometimes four if you're doing really well or you have some sort of competitive advantage and so and again and that may sound soft to you in terms of those numbers but the reality is that a lot of people just look at the the outliers which catch all the news in the press but most businesses every
(08:03) you know businesses are sold every day at 1x 2x 3x ebitda all the time just no one wants to talk about it right and so this is even closer to reality so if i'm looking at a business owner or somebody's trying to posture with me right the eggplant measuring contest of of of entrepreneurship they're gonna if they're starting to talk to me about these numbers i'm like hey bro like what are we doing bottom line right what are we doing bottom line per year this is what i want to know and so that leads me naturally to the next one
(08:29) which is okay well you've got a you've got a certain amount of ebitda that's coming up but depending on your type of business you might have to reallocate all that money back into the business to just maintain your competitive advantage which charlie munger warren buffett uh they talk about how their least favorite type of businesses are businesses that require lots of additional capital right now as they've become gazillionaires they have to find businesses like that because they have to put their capital to work but for the thing that created
(08:52) their wealth was finding businesses that did not require a lot of additional capital that created lots of survey says net free cash flow so how much owner earnings how much can you extract from the business all right that's what this nfcf here is net free cash flow right and i've talked about this in other videos but this is after i've reinvested profits in the business to maintain and grow our competitive advantage how much can i as the owner take out the reason this is so important is because a lot of times you're not going to sell
(09:20) a lot of times businesses fail there are tons of risks that's why business is one of the riskiest things to get into most businesses do not succeed that's just those are just the stats right and 99 times out of 100 your business never actually sells you might do an asset sale or a garage sale but doesn't actually sell for what you think it is which is why for me as an entrepreneur you want to de-risk by extracting cash flow and many times this is one of the values of the business and so if i'm talking to an entrepreneur
(09:43) and they tell me this then i'm going to probably ask well what are you babe what are you taking home and owner earnings what are you extracting from business what are you taking out as dividends because i want to know what's reality right and that leads me to the last and the bottom one here and then i'll give you my ratings on these which is what's your net worth right this is what entrepreneurs you know everyone's shying away from talking about a lot of guys that you see on your newsfeed those guys message me
(10:04) and say hey man i want to do x y and z i want to start investing et cetera and they've got a half a million dollars for their name and they talk about how they've done 10 million dollars in revenue right right lifetime and so again you could just i'll give you a funny example for you so if someone um says hey we've done a million dollars in revenue look at our award right that's over a total lifetime right that could be over 10 years so if you did a million dollars revenue for 10 years means you're doing 100 000
(10:27) a year in revenue right and if you're doing 50 margins on that right that's a 50 000 a year owner income business which is just the median income in the united states and there's nothing wrong with that but in terms of taking this person as an authority i would be i would be hesitant to to take their advice because candidly they're they're probably just spending what they're making on living if that's how they're trying to position so just just take that with a grain of salt you know what i mean and the reason i'm going through this is
(10:55) because the best thing you can do is learn from others but to make sure that you're actually learning from others learning from people who are good information sources is important and can there's tons of people who know way more about business but i just try to share the stuff that has worked well for us in creating you know for me an ultra high net worth which is over 30 million and there's two aspects of net worth all right you have your net worth that comes from your investable assets which is what you've extracted
(11:20) right we've extracted paid your taxes on and then been able to reinvest and grow and the second is the percentage of the businesses that you own business or businesses that you own all right which is why having a fair and reasonable valuation is important because what's the true market value of the business that you have now if someone says like my business does like 10 million a year and they do 2 million of ebitda right and they're getting a five times multiple on that because it's truly a business it doesn't require
(11:46) their face if it requires their face then they're not going to get that multiple right so it's important to understand these variables that create and measure value in a business because if you're looking for people and you're trying to listen to advice then make sure you're getting it from the sources that are true and real again two different ways that that can combine to create net worth is going to be your after tax wealth that you've extracted from the business and be able to reinvest on the side and grow on your own
(12:12) right and the percentages of the businesses that you own the value around them all right so let's get to the good part which is um yay or nay is this something that i'd be looking at uh in terms of uh whether i'm going to value this person's opinion based on this stat alone survey says contract value no i would not do that and that is because this can be wildly inflated especially if you extrapolate on one month's contract value for the rest of the year it can be wildly inflated all right so number two lifetime revenue survey says no
(12:44) i would not use this as a way of measuring how good someone is at uh at business because you want to know how long was that was that over 20 years was it over 40 years because that's what a mcdonald's employee can earn over that amount of time alright so don't be impressed by this number ask more questions which we which you should hopefully do as we go down this all right business valuation survey says yes but caveat on this you want to know what type of multiple are you assuming um and what is that off of top line or
(13:12) bottom line and why can you defend that right so this is asking good questions so that you can actually get closer to true value which is why all these metrics even exist to begin with it's so that people going to ascribe and measure value all right next one yearly revenue survey says ah partial answer because it goes with number five which is yearly profit all right the difference here if someone's doing 100 million dollars a year in top lane revenue and they're spitting out um just a little bit of profit that may be
(13:37) okay right if you're doing 500 000 a year in profit i knew a company that um 20 million in revenue 500 thousand year profit they got sold for 168 million right now that's a super valuable business and it's because the bankers and the people who bought it saw that they had reinvested everything right into growing the business so understanding the relationship between these two things if i have another business that's doing 500 000 a year and a million dollars a year in top lane revenue then it's to be a far less valuable business
(14:03) all right so understanding that they might be making some strategic decisions about how they're reinvesting the business et cetera or some capital costs that might have cost them but they see what it's going to yield them in the future etc all right now um this is especially true with software businesses fyi all right which that particular business was a software business next one survey says yes on netflix flow this is uncle warren this is uncle charlie munger this is their primary uh metric for measuring business they try and
(14:29) figure out what is the net free cash flow after i reinvest everything this is an excellent way excellent way to figure out the value of the business all right because if you can do your net free cash flow and then you multiply it then you're going to get very close to what an investor might be willing to pay for the asset excluding some sort of crazy monopoly thing that they're trying to get with some sort of category king uh you know situation in a marketplace and then finally net worth how do we see this on the on
(14:56) the valuing of uh eggplant right survey says yes i think this is an excellent measure uh of value because this is what is left after all the chips all the chips have fallen all the cookies have crumbled all the uh the roosters have roosted this is what's left after everything right because if you you know if you like i've had 13 businesses and i now own eight more so i've had 21 businesses right um so i've had a lot of these things and the thing that remains is you your net worth is an entrepreneur and if you look at the fortune 500 and you look
(15:28) at it 50 years ago what you'll see is that there's only two businesses that are still on the the fortune 500 from now from 50 years ago g and ford that's it that's it right and so when you think about that a lot of times what what business becomes is you create something and then as an entrepreneur you want to be able to create enough personal wealth throughout the trajectory of the business that's like literally all businesses fortune 500 and only two of them right are still there and so thinking about that that should
(15:55) hopefully shift your perspective which is why i'm so big on extracting dividends while the business is growing and i know that that might not be as popular in the silicon valley world but a lot of those guys don't live in reality and for the everyday business owners everyday entrepreneurs that are you know hustling out there trying to make a buck trying to feed their families it's important to de-risk because you can't put all your eggs in the single basket that is my opinion sure you can bet on yourself but there
(16:19) are so many more stories of guys who bet everything on themselves at the casino and walked away empty-handed all right and so it is my belief that if you were generating a profit you should be purposely taking some out every month even though the like for me the vast majority of my net worth is in my business valuations still i still have you know over whatever a lot um in in in investable assets um that categorizes me as ultra high net worth all right and so again ultra net worth just so you know from the definition standpoint is
(16:45) investable assets it's not based on total value these are the seven ways that i wanted to highlight for measuring value if you see someone and they say i am worth this or my business is worth this or i built an x million dollar business ask these questions is that lifetime revenue is that contract value that's been extrapolated is that your business valuation based on what multiple is that based on a top line multiple or is that based on a bottom line multiple what's the net free cash flow what are you taking out as dividends every year
(17:13) and then finally if someone will share it with you which i i'm actually not that opposed to sharing net worth numbers i know some people are i don't really know why i figure if you make enough money over time people always end up finding out what your net worth is which is basically the entire forbes list and so anyways these are the ways that you measure value these are my two second snap judgments on them and if you have if you have your astute cap on then you probably figured out that a lot of these things go together
(17:37) right and it's not just one number it's understanding the interplay between them so that you can ascertain with the true value of a business and or the entrepreneur that owns it is so hope you found valuable in that i hope you found valuable in that hit the subscribe button if you did and if you didn't then don't hit the subscribe button uh leave a comment if you have any other questions or other things that you would like me to talk about because i just like to make the stuff that you guys want because that's what this is for

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone happy uh saturday today um i uh wanted to make this podcast for you because i got off the phone with uh ed terney and he and i had a long conversation about a wide breadth of topics and he's like dude you should talk more about this kind of stuff and so what i want to do is actually share with you um kind of my experience of having the chip on my shoulder and kind of where it got me and what i learned in the process and so if you have any kind of like thoughts around uh like trying to beat someone and like
(00:38) like you're gonna take these guys down and like all this stuff and i know many many people in this space uh you know feel that way towards me i can tell you having literally gone through the entire process um it's it's really interesting so like when i when i had my gyms i i wrote this huge essay and it was for myself because i actually have a creative writing background that most people don't know about um but i entitled it uh that everyone wishes for the american dream and roots for you for the american dream until it
(01:09) comes true and i felt that way with my clients you know they were rooting for me when i was sleeping on the floor they're like good for you like pursuing your dreams and um but as time went on you know and i started to be able to hire people we started making more money um and eventually i didn't have to work in the business they're like oh you're too good for us now like oh a big businessman right and everyone roots for you um until you do better than them and so what ends up happening is that you have to set higher and higher goals for
(01:37) yourself to drive yourself right and for me i uh definitely was an angrier person or maybe i'm just better at hiding it now i have no idea um but i was definitely angrier about stuff and i set this goal that i was going to beat bedros if you guys recall who badros cooley and he's a big guru or was big guru in the in the gym space uh he owns fit body and and i i started telling myself all of these things you know what i mean like how he's wronging people and he's ripping people off and i would tell myself these
(02:11) stories you know what i mean to try and like get myself amped up about like how i'm just gonna like write the industry and and do everything and i'm gonna be bigger than him and like all this stuff right and the reality is um you know as as time went on and and you know jim lunch grew and we grew and grew and grew and um you know i'm not i don't know what his numbers are but i'm fairly certain that our coaching program is and has been bigger than his in this space at least for a while and when i got there um you know i guess to to the higher you
(02:45) know to to match that and surpass um first off i found that it was incredibly empty um but secondly i felt and realized that he was completely unaffected uh he had uh he was still incredibly wealthy uh he had other entrepreneurial endeavors he was pursuing and this my success in no way affected his life and it was one of the most humbling and also freeing moments of my life when i realized that because it he wasn't an enemy i and i doubt i was even you know like a blip on the radar um during that time and i mean obviously
(03:30) they know who we are now but um it it didn't affect his life and all this malicious you know list this vengeance this vendetta that i had like the only person it poisoned was me and you know there's two sides to this coin on on one side you have like the the drive um you know if you guys have seen the jordan documentary talks about how used to make things up that other people would say about them that they never actually said and i feel like it's kind of like that and it's and that chip on your shoulder does drive you so
(04:01) i can't say it didn't drive me but i don't think it made me a happier person and so and believe me i'm not the guy who's like go go hug trees and be happy like i'm all about achieving uh achieving stuff so like by all means go do whatever works for you but i can tell you that it seeing it truly seeing my success not in any way impact someone else's success really radically transformed my feelings about competitors about the space about the industry about other coaches in general about what i was willing to do to help other coaches etc
(04:41) it really transformed me um i started calling up other people who were in our space and just saying like hey how can i help you grow and they're like seriously and i was like yeah man i'm like i mean you're not gonna take my stuff and i'm not gonna take your stuff because people are attracted to different people for different reasons you know people like everyone has different psychographics that they attract like i'm 81 male like women in general don't find my my content uh appealing i'm just saying like those are that
(05:07) that's the data right those are the stats um but the thing is is that uh by freeing myself of this i realize it didn't impact my success at all and other people growing with my you know with me helping or without me helping didn't affect my success either but it did massively affect my mental well-being um and so i guess there's two sides to this message that you can take one is if you were the you know the line climbing up the mountain um by all means stay hungry as hell do whatever it takes for you to stay motivated um but i would say don't
(05:44) don't do anything stupid you know don't don't don't say anything don't don't take massive you know malicious attacks i didn't do that but i'm just saying like don't do that because you will end up burning bridges i've had a lot of people do that to me and i'm sure bedros has had it too and you know some of the guys have been in the space for a long time have had people do that and what ends up happening is that you just kind of burn your reputation and you know what's gonna happen is somebody who's taking a massive you know swipe at
(06:12) me um you know they're gonna want to do a deal with someone else and that guy's gonna call me and he's like what do you think about this guy i'm like ah i think he's a little bit i think he's naive i think he's i think he's noob i think he's small bones i think he's an emotional person i don't think he's able to restrain himself i think he's very volatile i wouldn't do business with him if it were me um you can do whatever you want and i would just be like this is my experience with it i would i don't touch people like that with a 10-foot pole but
(06:38) do what you want and usually when people hear that you know from someone that they think is less volatile they will usually heed that advice and there's been probably a lot of people who have taken attacks at me who somehow find things that just fall through for them um and that may or may not have been as a result of you know me but the point is that i think that that anger um use it to fuel yourself but don't don't use it to attack um it just doesn't end up going well and also people make associations with how they feel
(07:09) about what you say and so if you're always talking negatively in general about other people people will not remember who you were talking about but they will remember how you made them feel and they will associate the negativity with you and so that's something that um i learned early on in like some of the persuasion books i was like oh okay i need to watch out for that and so it's hard for me especially because i was like so angry when i was younger um that to not do that right and so um that's that's one side of it right is if
(07:35) you were if you were climbing the mountain um and i guess the message to the other side is that like it's just you're not gonna affect anything like you're not gonna hurt anyone by your success and that's like that's probably the biggest message i can give is like you're not gonna hurt anyone like it's not like you're not gonna hurt anyone like when people make swipes at me i was like it doesn't hurt me like it doesn't affect me at all um like it doesn't affect my business it doesn't it just it just affects you
(08:02) um and i'm only sharing this because like it was something that i think really hurt my mental well-being when i was younger and i and if i can provide value you know i hope that it doesn't affect those people if they see this um so anyways and maybe that's you you know maybe it's maybe there's a competitor in your space or maybe there's another you know another business down the street that you're like screw this guy blah blah blah blah i can promise you you would make so much more money if you guys just like talked
(08:28) and shared like best practices because it there's so few markets where it's actually winner take all there's it's there's so few you know what i mean that it actually works that way it's a zero-sum game the reality is that most businesses can't even handle the amount of demand that there is for the service and the solution that they have or the problem that they solve and the other reality is that there's a lot of people that like things solved in different ways you know if layla and i were entering the weight
(08:55) loss space it's not like i have to start attacking weight watchers you know what i mean like there's just certain people who are attracted to that type of messaging and if layla and i got in that space we'd probably have a very different angle brand message look and feel than they would and we would attract different types of people with different values and so it's there's a lot of room and the ocean's very very big it's so much bigger than everyone gives you credit for um and that's i think i told a story recently about a competitor
(09:22) quote competitor another per another companies in our space who's who's doing this like the same amount as i as we are and they're not even they're not even like marketing on facebook and i'm like are you kidding me and they have an entire outbound team and when i heard that i was just like gosh i just like i continue to have my mental barriers stretched around these concepts of like the game is so big and the only person you hurt when you spit hate is yourself um you you hurt your long-term prospects because people
(09:48) at the top do talk like it's like there definitely is like i think i heard andy fercello say this it's like everyone stops just like hanging out like they're all just like most of us know each other you know what i mean and like we text each other and hey how's this working for you hey how's this where like there's no animosity like i'm friends with a lot of people who are in the gym space who serve jim owners like i have no malicious intentions someone's like hey should i work with so-so i'm like give them a shot you know
(10:10) what i mean like everyone has a different way of doing things um you know this is what ours works well with and if you like our style and you like you know you like selling hard you like going high ticket you like marketing hard uh you like focusing on metrics like that's us you know what i mean like there's people who like more done for you like that's cool too like there's guys who do that really well so anyways i uh i wanted to share this with you because uh ed inspired me uh to share this message with you because um
(10:38) if you you know if you are angry or you've you have this uh angered inside of yourself i 100 get you i feel you um but i would just say try and use it to spur yourself on do not use it to throw shade because it will not benefit your well-being and it won't benefit your long-term success so anyways i hope you found that valuable hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like or comment or review or just uh listen solemnly uh but anyways hope you have an awesome day and a happy saturday and i'll catch you guys soon bye

The Choice | How To Improve Decision Making Skills - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:01) what's going on everyone uh last night i was speaking uh i was one of the speakers and clubhouse it's a new app uh you can follow me there it's at hormozy um but anyways i i was i was one of the speakers of this app and they were asking questions like if you had to start all over you know what would you do what's the biggest mistakes you've made and things like that and one of the things that came up in my mind is one of the hardest things about being an entrepreneur which is the disconnect between the right decision and the right outcome
(00:32) and so let me explain so you've you if you've listened to my stuff i talk about repeating successful actions right find something that works and keep doing it over and over again right but the thing is is your decision-making process is ultimately the most valuable thing valuable thing that you have right it's what makes you it's your picker right it makes you decide what what way to go who you're going to marry what business opportunity you're going to pursue how you're going to price how you're going to start marketing what you're
(00:52) going to learn first who you're going to you know get mentoring from all of these things so you're going to become friends with like all of these are decisions right and you know you can take the money away from a billionaire and then they can recreate it again elon musk you know lost it and then gained it all back right and so like the thing is is the decision making is what ultimately fuels all these things and the hardest part about entrepreneurship and really i mean i think almost life in general is that you can make the right decision
(01:21) and have the wrong outcome and i think and let me give you a couple examples of this so for example um you may say you know what like i look i listen to warren buffett i think he's a good investor and so he says i wouldn't i wouldn't touch bitcoin right and i hear that i'm like man well he knows a little bit more about it than i do but his argument was simple it is speculative which means i'm buying it not because it has intrinsic value but only because i believe that someone else will buy it for more later right that's all it is he only believes
(01:49) in investing in things that have intrinsic value and also produce right so they actually have production so like a business you buy you still own the business at the end and then it spits out production which would be profit or crops or whatever right so that's the basic difference right and so the thing is is that you can make the right decision so for example i chose not to buy bitcoin two years ago or whatever and now the amount of money that it would have been worth is a lot more was the decision wrong or was it that
(02:20) the outcome did not match the quality of the decision and so let me explain let me like unpack this if you are going to change the way you make decisions because a decision that you made in the past that was probably a good decision ended up bad you have to apply the same decision making context or framework to everything else all right so let me explain so if i say i'm now going to be a speculator right i'm going to be someone who buys things with the hopes of selling them later for more even though the thing itself doesn't
(02:51) have more value right if i choose to start making those types of decisions then i have to think about all the other investments i would have made and lost money on as a result of that decision making framework and the place that i heard this first was ray dalio in principles so he's one of the richest men in the world uh an investor as well he said one of the hardest things is passing up on an opportunity and then seeing it you know do really really well right he's like and but the thing is is i have to think to myself if i were to
(03:23) use the decision-making framework that would have made that deal a winner then i'd have to apply that same framework to all of these other businesses or situations that would have been losers and my net net of having that different decision making framework would ultimately cause me to lose and so this has been one of the most powerful concepts for me as an entrepreneur because what it does is it allows me to separate the outcome from the quality of the decision why was it that i did these things right and i i can't even tell you like
(03:50) so for example you know actually i won't even give that one but like their their decisions that i made when i was younger that ended up being you know poor later but when i thought back about why i made the decision i would make the same decision today so it's not fair for me to say well i wouldn't have made the same call now but you can't use the information that you have today to make the decision that you would have made in the past because then it means that you're a different person because you're not using information that you
(04:19) have access to right and so claiming that the this decision that i did in the past that didn't end up well you know working out in my favor was the wrong call can just be really poisonous and it may not be true now if you make a mistake because you had poor calculations and you repeat the same mistake over and over again then you should consider looking at your decision-making calculus and see if you need to tweak some things right but for me this has been one of the hardest learned lessons and emotionally one of the most trying
(04:47) is looking at decisions i've made looking at the outcome and being able to separate was this a good decision independent of the outcome and i'll wrap this up with just a quick example to show you if you had a perfect baseball swing right you're just an amazing you know batter right if someone gets up there and they're the best batter in the world and you strike out is it because their swing is horrible is it because they they don't have the right decision making about how they swing at pitches or how they pick the pitches
(05:17) probably not he's probably really good batter right because i just said he's the best but it still means he's going to strike out and it still means he's going to he's gonna get out and hit pop flies and all that kind of stuff but he's gonna be an amazing batter with three you know 350 average or whatever and still two out of three times he's gonna strike out or basically you know not get on base get out and so when i think about that like you can be the best at this thing and still only be right a certain percentage of the time
(05:41) right and so rather than that batter striking out once and saying i need to change my swing and then getting back up there and striking out again and be like i need to change my swing and always resetting the baseline instead being like i understand that if i apply this swing to enough at bats quite literally i will get the opportunity to knock it out of the park and me knocking out of the park on one of these right decisions will ultimately outweigh the negatives of the wrongs that i have done right um and so for me obviously with in the
(06:10) context of your own life like i talk about decision making in other videos but you want to make sure that you never bet the farm and you don't put everything on black when you cannot afford to lose right like don't bet everything but i mean sometimes you know things get crazy but for the most part don't bet everything the point being just like a big ball player you're going to have these decisions that you have to make and not changing your decision calculus your decision maker your picker every single time is going to ultimately
(06:38) allow you to judge the quality of your decisions based on these principles and so that is one of the hardest things that i've had to learn and i hope that the illustration with baseball made sense to you if it did drop a comment otherwise keeping awesome i'll catch you guys next vid bye

Why Coaches Get So Much Hate (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wN8n3qrqnQ

Transcript:
(00:00) people who had mentors and coaches experience four times greater success than the exact same person doing it on their own uh it is something that is highly debated uh oddly um and you see you know internet gurus you see coaches all over the place right and the the reason i wanted to talk about this is i think it's a super important uh topic for a variety of reasons one is why you know why is it important but secondly why do coaches get so much hate right and so i wanted to uh tell you what the data says what the science says
(00:38) and so i was having a conversation with dr cashie who some of you guys know is a very close friend of mine um and he was saying that he had just seen a paper that was a mega meta-analysis of the impact of coaching and mentorship on success right on how people um are doing right and they found over 40 000 uh research studies and when they consolidated all of the information and they controlled for income and you know iq and all of the different things that could that could uh make one person do better than another
(01:11) people who had mentors and coaches experience four times greater success than the exact same person doing it on their own alright and to me that seems like the most no-brainer reason i mean why would you i mean who wouldn't want to have four times greater success or four times faster results um by having that right and the thing is is despite knowing that despite knowing that every professional athlete and every olympian and every every major team has coaches for some reason the general population or people at large still have so much
(01:46) hate for them right um and you can if you've ever had any kind of coach you can probably think back and think like yes i was coaching with this person and then many many times people have a negative impression of that person who they worked with all right and so i like to dive into these types of things because i see like huge generalities you know sweeping across the board um and i'm by no means immune to this i have tons of people that i've helped you know go from broke to million dollar plus gym that now avidly speak against me um and
(02:16) i just like to think like what caused this right and so i was reading um i think it's 50 scientific ways which is a phenomenal book by the way 50 scientific ways to uh persuade people or to get the yes camera word something like that it's uh one of robert kialdini who is the author of influence and persuasion which are both two of the best books on influence and marketing and sales that exist um so he's co-author of this book in one of the chapters highlighted uh something that i thought was like a huge eye-opener for me and it
(02:46) was that when doing a favor for someone all right i'll show you how this relates to coaching when doing a favor for someone the perception of the favor and how important how big it was actually correlates with time and so immediately after you do a favor for someone the person who received the favor thinks super highly of you because they were just in pain and they're immediately relieved from the pain they were in and then at that moment is when they believe what you did for them to be of the of the highest importance of them of the
(03:20) highest impact on their life then over time it just continues to decline right over time over time it continues to go down of what their perception of what your favor was and what it did for your their lives now where this gets interesting is that the perception of the favored doer of you right if you did the favor you believe that the amount of effort and the amount of impact it had on the person's life goes up over time and so immediately after you you do something for someone is the moment you feel like it was it was nothing it wasn't a big
(03:55) deal i just you know i just did this and this but the person who received it was like oh my god this was like i was stuck on this for two years and it was horrible and as soon as you came in everything changed right but if you revisit that same story six months later the person who got the favor is like i mean i would have figured it out anyways you know i'm a pretty i'm a pretty smart guy i really wanted to do it if it wasn't that guy was someone else i was gonna figure it out right it wasn't that big of a deal
(04:20) and then the person who did the favor is like oh my god i saved this guy's life and he doesn't even blah blah blah right whatever but the point is is that this is a psychological bias and it's it's just real it's just in people and so in recognizing that it can give you a little bit for me of solace because i'm just like okay you know what's what's going on here um but it's just it's a it's a scientifically proven psychological bias that exists in all humans and so i think that there's a couple of of takeaways that i've taken
(04:51) from this and that you can too um is that one if you if you if you're doing any kind of coaching right it could be fitness coaching it could be you know it could be you're being a doc and i'm using coaching in a broad term it could be mentorship it could be you know what i mean it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be business related it could be anything right is that if you so this is purely just me giving you the tactics by this if you do someone a favor the time to ask for a favor and return is immediately
(05:19) immediately after you've done the favor because at that point is where they will believe what you did for them was of the most importance right now you can also get into probably secondary effects of this which is well if you can continue to do favors over time right then you continue to have those those windows of of goodwill right and i think of it like a telephone telephone wire so if you guys under old school i don't even know of course this thing is so many telephone or power lines where you know there's a pole and
(05:48) then it dips down and then there's another pole and then it dip down and then it's another pole and just think of each of those poles as the goodwill or the or the things that you do to help uh people out but if you don't do that then it just continues to go down and it touches the ground and then it you know the wire blows up because of whatever right and so um i just find this really interesting because favors i think also act a lot like information right and if you sell information like i do right i sell a business model i sell
(06:17) sales trainings i sell you know how to how to generate customers all that kind of stuff right is that information although incredibly valuable upon consumption immediately decreases in value in perceived value to the person who consumed it and so information is one of those interesting things that is incredibly value but declines in value very rapidly all right and so this is why if you are teaching people things you need to consistently teach new things on a regular basis so that they can continue to have those
(06:49) telephone poles of over and over again you breaking a belief or teaching a new thing or whatever it is so that they can continue to grow and i do think that over time there's some level of goodwill that gets built um but still most people are functioning on the what have you done for me lately right and i just you can you can be resentful of that and you can be the favor doer who's like i changed this guy's life um or you can just deal with the reality is that people don't care right they'll just think about what you did for them lately
(07:15) and so i just see this as incredible like as as statements of truth and so then you can just act in accordance with that it's like so if you if you want you know you help someone lose 25 pounds working with you then get the testimonial at that time right at that moment right don't wait and then ask for it six months later because at this point they're gonna be like well i was gonna join another gym you know i was gonna probably do something either way and it was really me who's doing all the dieting i mean yeah you know he helped
(07:42) right whereas if you've done it right after they get off the scale and you tell them to come right in and you do a great video they'll have all the emotions they'll just have gotten out of pain they'll have achieved their their thing and the thing is they'll probably far more accurately depict how much of a change you really did in their lives right and so i think this has far-reaching uh implications for a the psychology of the coach but also be the psychology of the coach e right and i think that i've experienced this
(08:11) myself with different coaches that i've had throughout my life recognizing myself internally is like you know i look back on what they did and i think those same thoughts which is like i would have done it anyway i'm a winner winners win um and i was gonna happen now whether or not that's true doesn't really matter the point is is that they were still the one who helped me out right and so you know giving respect to those people i think has been something that uh in the beginning of my career i don't think i did
(08:37) um as much as i do now and i think it's partially just you know maybe it's age maybe it's experience maybe it's scar tissue you know um whatever it is but i have i think i have probably in the last year or two um been much better about giving massive amounts of respect to the people who helped me out earlier on in my life and um and let me give you a different framing as well if you're the person who got received the favor so i kind of talked about this from the coaching perspective but talk about it from the from the student perspective is that
(09:09) like in my book which was released two years ago or a year and a half ago whatever it is um i have acknowledgements in the back and i have all people who influence me on that page good and bad because i still learn tremendous amounts from some of the people who were what i would consider maybe negative mentors right i learned i learned what not to do a lot of times and still some of those people still broke beliefs of mine even if they weren't intending to right and so uh i think tony robbins talks about this
(09:37) where he says you know blame them you can't just blame your mom or your dad right for the insecurities they gave you also blame them for your resilience blame them for your ability to persevere blame them for all the positive characteristics that you developed as a result or in reaction to some of the negative things that they did right and so i think that if you can adopt that perspective it's one way mentally healthier for you two you won't burn bridges with people who probably did help you at some point and then three if you are the coach if
(10:10) you recognize that this is going to be a cognitive bias this is going to be a psychological bias that's the need in all humans then you can adjust the way that you fulfill your business or you fulfill your coaching which is one if you want to get someone to recognize what you did for them you want to have that done immediately or as soon after they achieve their result right and then secondarily you want to continue to put post up those telephone poles week after week month after month so that you don't have to have that
(10:36) information decline over time and the only way to do that is work right because it requires effort like we have to continue to innovate we have to continue to make things easier we have to continue uh to strive to solve the next problem because the good news for everyone is that every single student you ever have as soon as you solve a problem a new problem will be created from the gap that you just that you just bridged right they will just go across the bridge to the next plateau where there's another gap where they need
(11:05) another bridge belt and so as long as you've been farther far ahead enough of the the people that you are teaching coaching mentoring student team right um you will be able to continue to build bridge after bridge after bridge for those people and it will force you to grow as a as a coach as an entrepreneur as a business owner as as whatever right because you will force to level yourself up so that you can continue to provide value because the value that you provided has an expiration date so um i hope you found that valuable hopefully
(11:34) that interesting for me i think it was really uh once i kind of connected all those pieces together uh it made a lot of sense in my own life for me as a student but also for what i've you know experienced uh as a as a quote coach or mentor or i hate the word mentor but you know whatever um as a you know as a as somebody who develops business models and helps other people uh make more profitable businesses it's been something that's been very valuable for me and honestly just very calming uh to my spirit and so anyways i hope that
(12:01) makes sense to you i hope you found that valuable and if you did tag coach uh tag one of your coaches take some of your trainers tag some of your friends family dogs pet higher power whatever it is um otherwise have an amazing day hope you guys have a crushing tuesday and i'll talk to you guys on the flip side [Music] you

3 Ways To Increase Wealth Through Business Now - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWlHPyAico

Transcript:
(00:00) so these are the three biggest levers for growth in a business three big levers for biz growth all right going up all right the first is going to be your market all right and so the reason that uh investors look at this stuff is because they know that if you put a great entrepreneur in a bad market or a bad market or a a bad entrepreneur in a great market the market will usually win and so let me tell you a quick story about this to illustrate this point so uh one of my friends lloyd owned a uh a great tech company he started it
(00:37) probably a decade ago and they grew pretty quickly and then it sort of plateaued and then it started to go down and he was trying to figure this out and he was struggling with it and he called me up one day and he was like hey dude what do you think the issue is with this and i was like dude you're you're selling your software to newspapers because that was his exclusive customer for his his ad product and despite having an amazing offer and being a great salesman because there was a zero risk offer for them he only just rev shared with them
(01:05) despite both of those things he was not able to grow because he was in the newspaper market which was shrinking by 25 every single year over eight years that he had the business right he still has it to the side but for eight years she was trying to figure out what was going on and he looked at every single piece of the business except for probably the most obvious one which is the market itself and so what i want to introduce with these three that levers and that's the first one is the market is you have to do these from the top
(01:31) down all right if you're in a horrible market it doesn't matter how good your offer is it doesn't matter how good your persuasive abilities are you prob you will not be able to outpower a bad market and so the way i look at these levers is is this going to be a plus is it going to be uh you know a neutral or is it going to be a negative right and so as long as your market is not a negative and is either a neutral or a plus you can move on to the second lever for business growth all right the second lever is your offer all right
(02:01) and what i mean by that is what you're literally giving a customer in order to transact with them all right this is the the the products and services that you offer in exchange for money and in the terms under which you offer them and what they need to do to redeem them all right that is in essence what an offer is all right and so these are the terms the price etc and what they get now if you're in a normal market or a good market if you're in a good market it doesn't matter right uh if you were you know selling toilet paper during covet
(02:32) it didn't matter uh what uh what your offer was or how persuasive you were which is the third one uh you were just you were in the right market at the right time and you're gonna make a ton of money right but most of us are in this market most of us are just in normal markets that are growing a normal amount and the nice thing is if you're in one of those markets you can still make a tremendous amount of money by offering a unique offering and a good product right and so the offer is going to be the second thing now if you have
(03:00) an incredible irresistible offer then more people will say yes and you can make a tremendous amount of money but again here you can have an amazing offer you can have a normal offer or you can have a shitty offer right and as long as you do not have a a shitty offer or a normal offer you can move on to the next one all right which is the third big lever all right which is persuasion all right so some people are naturally good persuaders they're good um they're good marketers they're good sales people and the thing is is that each of these
(03:31) is more important than the rest all right so it goes from the top down so i'll give you some examples if i were in an amazing market it doesn't matter if my offer persuasion abilities are good i'll make a ton of money if i'm in a bad market it doesn't matter if i'm in a good persuasion and good offering i'm not going to make any money and so basically you can just move from the top down and check these off your list and so most of us are going to be here in this normal market right a normal market you serve dentists you serve
(04:00) chiropractors you serve normal people who are in pain those are normal markets they're not growing they're not shrinking they're just normal right now from there we move to our offer now the thing is is that this is typically the easiest lever on any business to grow the business because any business it takes a little bit of time to go from a normal offer to an amazing offer you can't really go from a normal market to an amazing market with your business unless you change your entire business but with an offer you simply can repackage the value
(04:31) proposition how you charge in the terms under which you offer your services and you can move from having a normal offering or a subpar offering to an amazing irresistible offer i call them grand slam offers and the reason i call them that is because grand slams are both very rare and very good but the difference between baseball and business is that when you have a grand slam offer you can knock the ball so far out of the park you can win for a thousand years and that's the difference right in baseball you can only win four runs no
(04:58) matter how good your offer is in business you go in for life and so making the actual best offer is going to be the second biggest lever on your business now let's assume that you've got a great offer now if you have crap persuasion skills you'll still make money if you have normal persuasion stills you'll make a lot of money if you have fantastic persuasion skills you'll make a tremendous amount of money alright which leads me to the next piece so let's assume that you just have a normal offer not an amazing offer all
(05:27) right then it takes us to our third portion here the only way if that is your scenario you're in a normal market you're normal you have a normal offer the only way for you to be hyper successful is to develop persuasion abilities and so that's learning how to market and sell how to acquire customers through multiple channels right and so the thing is is that this one is usually the most difficult to acquire in my opinion it takes a lot of time takes a lot of effort takes a lot of volume to a lot of practice a lot of failure in
(05:53) order to get good at this all right and so if i'm looking at a business and i'm trying to grow it the first thing i'm going to do is check this off is just say like are we making sure that we're not in a bad market and we're at least in a normal or good market you'll know if you're in a good market believe me like i said if you're selling toilet paper cover 19 if you're selling hot dogs outside of a baseball stadium as soon as the game lets out you know you're in a good market right but most of us are here so as long as i'm
(06:15) not in a bad market i move on to the next one and so if i'm looking at the business i say okay what is the current offering what are we doing in exchange for money what are we giving clients right what are the terms of the agreement what's the price point and what are they getting in exchange all right and so then what i will do is shift the business from here in this direction to create a grand slam offer and the beautiful thing is this can literally take a half a day maybe a day right where you just re recombine repackage reposition rename
(06:45) the offers change the terms under which you you make you you offer your businesses and services and products and overnight you can take a normal business to an extraordinary business by doing this one thing all right and then finally the last thing that you can do is you can develop all the skills of persuasion so if you're looking at the entrepreneurial journey my recommendation for most people is i start here this is the first thing i will do the second thing i will do is get them to focus here you know improving this skill and going from a
(07:14) normal sales person to a normal marketer to an exceptional sales person marketer because they should already be being reasonably successful because we fixed the offer first and then move up to the top the biggest lever and say now that we understand how to make amazing offers how to persuade people in masses now let's go find a market that we know we can apply this skill set to that we think is going to crush it so right now if your business is not growing it might be because you are lacking one two or all three of the levers that
(07:43) create success and so if that hopefully that found you you found that valuable hopefully you can think about your own business within this context am i in a a great market a normal market or a shrinking market is my offer insanely compelling is it normal or is it bad uh my are my persuasion abilities exceptional can i acquire clients at the snap of my fingers whenever i want uh do they come in kind of semi-consistently but you know i can't really grow it or do i have no idea what i'm doing and i get i get people on the phone and i can never get
(08:12) money right and so if you can rate yourself on these things then you can identify where you have opportunities for growth and then follow these steps to get to where you want to go so hopefully that you found value in that hopefully that was cool in terms of in terms of framing how growth and the biggest levers that exist in business overall uh and keeping awesome and i will uh see you on the flip side bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) i was sitting in my quarterly leadership meeting where everyone had flown into vegas for two days to talk about the next quarter and our goals for the company and i stood there and i was listening to what they were saying and i wanted to light my head on fire what transpired next was a problem-solving process that i want to share with you because it unlocked 10 million to 12 million dollars in annual revenue for us that we had not been able to unlock for two quarters because of one simple misdiagnosed problem and so the purpose of this video
(00:31) is to hopefully get you to one avoid making that mistake but two be able to use this framework so that you can solve the right problems in your business so if you guys don't know my name uh my name is austin mosey i own acquisition.com it's portfolio companies do about 85 million a year the reason i make these videos is because a lot of people are broke and i don't want to be one of them all right so inside of our quarterly meeting for two quarters in a row my sales manager set the goal that they wanted to add six
(00:57) more outbound reps two quarters in a row quarter came quarter left quarter came quarter left this is the third time that i've been hearing them make this goal and everyone was nodding their heads and writing them down and it seemed like everything was hunky dory and i stopped and i was like guys we've had this goal for for two quarters why do we expect it to be any different this time to set the same goal and nothing's going to happen and for context the reason i said 10 to 12 million is because every outbound rep generates about 2 million a
(01:25) year in revenue for my business and so for me to have six more reps is about 12 million so i'm not just pulling that out of nowhere that's where it comes from back to the story i asked him i was like why weren't you able to do this it's like well you know we lost a couple reps this last quarter even though we hired some new ones and we pretty much have the same amount as we we had before and i was like is that what happened the quarter before that too he's like well yeah i was like then how are you going to solve this problem it's like um
(01:50) i don't know and then it hit me i had been driving this guy and putting my pressure on this guy when he was not the constraint of the system let me explain in every system you have potential and you have constraints most entrepreneurs spend all their time trying to add potential to their business thinking that they are solving the constraint but we will always grow any system will grow up to its constraint and no further and so right now your business has a constraint you have to identify it and what makes macro
(02:21) speed happen is not is not the frenziness and the frenetic energy it's knowing which problems to solve in what order and the example i'm going to give you is showing you exactly why that didn't happen for one of my companies for this specific channel we were marketing on which is outbound had we identified this problem two quarters ago we would have added 10 million to our top line for this year which we won't have so instead we're going to get one quarter's worth of that so maybe add 2 million or 2 and a half million to top
(02:47) line when we should have added 10 or 12. because of this one problem and from the outside people are going to say oh well it was because of x y and z but they didn't diagnose the root problem do you know what it was i'll tell you so i then turned to my hr director and i said how many how many people are you sending the sales manager per week she was like well i sent him about uh one qualified candidate a week and i was like okay how many interviews does it take you to send one qualified candidate she said it
(03:14) takes five i was like okay manager how many of these final interviews does it take for you to get one person hired he was like four i was like so it takes us 20 people that we got to get through to get one new outbound rep he was like yeah it's like okay now given the churn that we had in the last quarter and two quarters because just fyi for everybody frontline positions in general tend to turn more than manager and leadership positions just this name of the game and i was like okay so what is our churn in
(03:41) that position it was like it's about 20 a quarter i was like okay i understood now simple math here if we have 10 people who are working outbound that's not the number but let's just say it's 10. and we lose 20 then it means we're losing two people a quarter if right now the process that you have gets us one new outbound rep per month and we're losing to a quarter that means we would net one new person per quarter that is going to be very short of our goal of six so what do we need to do we need to fix the actual hiring process
(04:08) in order to meet the goal and so what we did was we actually i asked the hr director i said why are we doing these one-on-one she's like well i thought we had to do that miscommunication right it's all it was a miscommunication so we don't need that for this position what she now did the solution to this problem was that she's setting up she's still running the ads she's still organizing the interviews but she set them all up for the sales manager to do group interviews and now he can do five group interviews for one
(04:35) hour per week and now he can pick one or two of those people and get them onboarded quickly and he can start hiring he will be able to hit his goal in that way and so the reason i tell the story is because i just missed out on a bunch of revenue that i should have been able to make because we were solving the wrong problem all of the focus was on the sales manager and and who he was bringing in and how he was training them rather than because that wasn't the constraint of the system rather than what is the acquisition process for
(05:05) talent and so i'll give you a framework that i wrote down somewhere that i'll probably share in another video but it's something called the quad marketing calendar most people have no marketing calendar smart people have one or two marketing calendars so the first marketing calendar and you can draw this you know what i'll do for you right now all right so the quad marketing calendar looks like this here you've got internal and you've got external so here you have employees and you've got prospects internally which is this way you should
(05:36) be marketing to your employees so that you tell them about the vision and about the mission about why you do what you do this has to happen all the time so that people continue to want to work for you internally to your prospects which are now customers over here you need to continue to market them to get them to buy again and again right we need to keep them to keep buying over here in external for prospects you need to get people to become customers so we're marketing externally most people understand this one this is the one that
(06:08) most people do most people don't do this one most people definitely don't do this one and i'll tell you the one that people miss the most this one is that they don't have an acquisition process for getting new talent so just like you run ads generate leads nurture leads set appointments sell fulfill you should be able to run ads for new employees you should be generating leads you should be working those leads you should be setting interviews which are sales you make job offers just like you make normal offers and then the onboarding experience that
(06:47) you have for a customer is the onboarding experience that you have in parallel with an employee and then just like you continue to ascend and resell your customers you ascend and continue to manage your employees these are parallel processes that happen in every business and most people don't know about it and you heard about it here first at the world's best youtube channel in the world with the the handsomest and most uh sickly now rona written uh youtuber out there and this is called the quad bargaining calendar and it was
(07:21) because we were missing this framework my hr director did not understand this framework that we lost out on 10 to 12 million revenue and i don't want you to do that all right and so the reason i made this video is so that you can recognize which of these four in the quad marketing calendar you are not using so that you can shore up that part of your business and ultimately scale it and make all of your wildest dreams intro all right my name's alex from rosie like i said on acquisition.
(07:47) com hope you enjoyed this video and guys i'll see you guys the next one keep being awesome bye

Transcript:
(00:00) last week layla and i signed our wills donating our entire estate to charity more or less that obviously happens after we die so it's not now but it was a really interesting experience for me to go through because it put a lot of things into perspective within life and so um i wanted to share some of the thoughts around that because i made an instagram post about it and it's gotten the most like likes and comments and interaction out of any post i've made to date and so i figured uh it was a point of interest
(00:27) the reasoning behind kind of that decision is um is is multi-fold and so i'll share that with you so the first is we are of the belief that i mean one we don't have kids and so we would have we have no like direct descendants we'd pass it to second even if we did have kids or have kids in the future i don't think that giving people a lot of money when they do not earn it is good for them all the people that i know who were given money um it ended up ruining their lives and so i would not wish that on any of the descendants that
(00:59) i have next piece is kind of the concept of legacy which is like why don't you want to do something like the rockefellers and have some big trust and it feeds every all of your generations from here on out i think there's these ideas that we all strive for of imper impermanence excuse me permanence because we want to live on after we die but i think it's just a human condition thing and it's just not reality you know if you think about like the sumerians civilizations from 5 000 years ago there's no one that we even
(01:26) know about we just know that they existed and that's about it and we don't know about the rich people and the poor people we don't know who started schools and who didn't we just know that they existed and i think that that may be the americans in you know 5 000 years from now and so there's the biological component of all right so when we die uh our kids are going to marry people and they're gonna have kids and those kids are gonna marry people and then you do that a hundred times and it's taking a 50 and then raising it to the
(01:50) hundredth power you know sorry a half and then just doing it over and over and over and over again right and so basically the amount of our genetic pool um if you want to look at it from a biological perspective of what 10 or 100 generations from now is is basically nothing right we're not really there and then the other piece of it is like will they know who we were or any of the character traits that we had will be passed on unlikely and so um for us uh it felt kind of like the right thing because we also feel like
(02:17) we've been given a lot and not just from being born in america and all that kind of stuff but um from a from a broader context i've shifted my perspective on i think business success over time and so like let me give you a visual example if you were to look at shaquille o'neal versus let's say a tiny asian lady right you could see a huge amount of genetic diversity just in that visualization and i think the same visualization appears mentally it's just not visual and so think about that for perspective so like it's like why is he so good at
(02:50) basketball well it's like if you look at him you'd be like well geez he's so naturally inclined for that i'm not to say that every person who has his genetic makeup would be you know as good as he was but they would have an inclination to be pretty good right and so i think that the same exists within your mental capacity and your character traits but predispositions for business like i wonder what if we were to look through that same visual lens what jeff bezos would look like mentally or what bill gates would look like mentally or
(03:14) what warren buffett would look like mentally and all of a sudden we might be like well it makes sense because he's seven eight you know what i mean of course he's good at investing or of course he's good at business or whatever and so i think that my perspective on this has shifted because if you had asked me when i was younger what made me you know successful or whatever i'm using quotes here i'm not saying we're the most successful people in the world or anything or far from it but i think that i would have said hard
(03:36) work sacrifice and all of that stuff but i think as i've gotten more perspective i think that we're just naturally good at it you know and i think that obviously work and sacrifice and those things hone the skill just like shaquille o'neal still has to go to practice but i think some people get disproportionate returns on their time and effort and so to give back after we are dead is not really asking that much beyond that um it also gave me another huge conclusion about my own life which is if i'm going to be donating all of
(04:00) this stuff when i die anyways then it makes more sense for me to start giving away while i am alive and i think that you know the first level of giving is obviously you can give money and layla and i have probably donated about a million dollars to the last few years to various charities that we believe in but i think what has what is more valuable is the skills um and the experiences and the the traits and the lessons that we have gathered along our journey that i think is more valuable and so the reasoning behind acquisition.com
(04:31) which for those who don't know us is our portfolio holding company right now it holds uh up seven companies are in entirety and then also percentages of and um that does about 85 million a year point behind you know this channel is to to hopefully transfer those lessons while we are alive to other people um because if we're going to give it all when we would die why not start now at least that's the that's the thought process behind it and so that's why um for those of you ask questions like that's why we are writing
(04:59) the books that's why i'm making the courses that's why i'm doing all that stuff and we're giving them away for free what's interesting is that i think that there's a shift that occurs and i'm just i guess noting this because my first businesses were created out of scarcity and so what i mean by that is they were created out of an insecurity they were created out of a deficiency they were created out of a deficit a need for something right one of my favorite quotes from naval ravicon is desire is a contract we make with
(05:24) ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want and i and i candidly us building those businesses was not like a happy experience for me it was very like grindy dark rage filled like just outwork out sacrifice type thing and what's interesting is when i look at the people who make a lot more money than me now they don't kind of act that way and i think it's because the motivation has to shift because if you are this at least for me it's like if i'm only trying to satisfy my own personal needs at 10 million or
(05:54) 20 million or 30 million whatever it is whatever your number is you know when you cross it maybe it's a million whatever it is when you when you cross that number in the bank all of a sudden you'll feel the the energy or the drive towards that satisfying that goal will diminish because you somewhat do right and so i think at that point there are two directions that you can kind of go in one direction is to make money the ultimate scorecard um which i'll give you an analogy of why i think that's silly in a second and the other is that
(06:20) you can change the driver all right and so for the first one the reason that i've never really been a big you know i've never espoused that or never been a big believer in that one is that i see the entrepreneurial journey as a casino and so bear with me for a second so imagine every one of us is given a token right as we you know come of age whatever that age is maybe it's 12 maybe it's 14 whatever it ages that you decide that you want to get in the game right and so we get a token and we go into the casino and we get a seat at the table
(06:48) and we continue to play we continue to play and we have the other players right and what's interesting is that everyone's playing for the chips that are on the table the difference is that you might amass this big amount of chips right but the thing is is that we don't get to cash out we literally just have to leave the table and then someone else takes our seat and all of our chips get pushed back into the middle of the table for other people to play with again and the other people you could say is your family the other people you could say is
(07:12) your competitors the other people you could see it's just the marketplace your community as a whole but either way we don't get to leave the casino alive and we don't get to leave with our chips and so having that perspective for me just really reinforces that it's just a game because we don't get to keep any of it and so once you've satisfied like once you can eat steak dinners every single night and it doesn't change anything and once you can buy private jets and once you can do all that stuff like nothing changes like
(07:37) more money changes literally nothing because money can only solve money problems and that was one of the lessons that i've learned as we've you know gained more of it is that money only solves money problems and once you've run out of money uh problems for money to solve there's really not a lot of utility for it that's why for me the the money scoreboard concept has never really resonated me dying a billionaire so what you know what i mean like i'm just going to take this big lump of money and then this is going to get handed to somebody
(08:07) else and so that is also why i don't think we want to give it to somebody else because you know an individual person because i think it would ruin them and one of my favorite cards in magic the gathering which is a game i played all the time when i was a kid it was burning wish and the the flavor text on that card was she wished for a weapon but not for the skill to wield it and that's very much how layla and i both see money is that it's just this raw power and the more that you get uh the more skill you must have in order
(08:38) to wield it effectively and so i think that that is why we don't we wouldn't want to quote ruin our descendants in that way or ruin anyone in that way because i think it's too much for one person to have and so that is why we're pushing it towards causes rather than individuals because i also think that when you give it to individuals you rob them of the opportunity to earn for themselves and you rob them of the opportunity to to to achieve in that way because i can tell you i remember when i was a kid and i thought about this really deeply when
(09:11) i was uh in college i thought to myself if i won the powerball right because i bought a ticket because it got like all you know all the guys that i knew all got one ticket because it was like a billion dollars or something at one point for the powerball and it's more just for the conversation that that that comes as a result of that that we bought it it's not because i thought there was like a chance or anything but what was interesting is that i realized that during the drawing i actually had this feeling of dread
(09:34) because i really didn't want to win because i realized that if i won then it would kind of make everything that i was wanting to do meaningless which was really weird for me to think about i was like if i just got a billion dollars then it would mean that i never even got to play the game or get the credit for earning whatever i would end up having because i wanted to have and this is probably my ego or my insecurities i wanted to have people give me status for having earned this right but i think again as i've
(09:59) gotten older my my thinking around that has changed because like there are so many things that i've been fortunate with you know what i was born with genetically you know what i mean i think that i have decent reasoning powers and i don't know how much of that is is learnable you know what i mean um i think you know i was born in the united states i was born a white male um i was born to um you know a doctor uh as a as a parent and so like there's lots of things that i have that already gave me a leg up and so
(10:31) anyways just to to bring this home for you the reason that we have acquisition.com and the reason that we are pushing far more towards giving away everything that we have is while we are alive and the most valuable assets we have which is the value that we can provide in terms of the lessons and skills is because i just have no more marginal utility for money now that being said it would be it would behoove me to kind of follow in uncle warren's footsteps which is i think that i will be a better allocator and multiplier of capital so that when i
(11:01) when we die we will be able to pass on and make a larger impact um on you know whoever you know whatever causes we donate our stuff to then if i were to donate it now and we do donate stuff now because you know i think about this where it's like i've given away two million dollars in the last two years and i think about two million dollars in 40 years and how if i you know allocated it well it would probably be like 100 million dollars right and i'm giving away all that money now but i think there's always the trade-off
(11:27) between consumption and investment that you know kind of all entrepreneurs make and the consumption investment trade-off happens kind of for everything it's like investing in your relationship versus consuming your relationship investing in the business versus consuming the benefits of the money and that kind of happens with everything right and so that is kind of the the thought process and the thinking behind the books and the courses and all that stuff behind acquisition.
(11:49) com for those of you asked um the big impetus behind this was uh you know donating what will you know just our current estate is probably valued between 60 and 80 million depending on who's valuing the equity slices we have in the businesses we own i know that if i were to do nothing and just wait you know 40 or 50 years hopefully i live that long it would be a very big number right even at ten percent it'll be over a billion dollars at that point and that's if we earn no more money between now and then and so i think that it changes the game and i'll
(12:17) leave you this with this one quote from naval rava cop that i think is really valuable you said retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for a hypothetical tomorrow and i think that what that will gave me was the permission to stop doing that because if i know that i'm not going to be i'm not going to be taking anything that i'm making now with me anyways and i'm going to be giving it a while all the way to begin with it pretty much eliminates the desire to trade time for money in any meaningful way besides things that that i you know
(12:47) enjoy and think that i can provide value with and so for the many of you that reach out i want to also say a couple things real quick one we don't sell time so i get probably like 100 dams a day asking if we do one-on-one consulting we do not we take on companies that are um i say three to ten million but closer to like the five to ten million plus mark just fyi unless you have something that's really interesting um and so we you know we invest and we take positions in those companies and help them grow for context at the time of this video
(13:16) the smallest business that we have in the portfolio is eight million a year um so just like i said four contacts that says three to ten but we're really skewing towards the heart the larger side of that and that is why um i don't consult for dollars that's also why we're not selling courses we're not selling masterminds we're not selling coaching and if you see comments in the thread that are replies from fake alex ramoses right now we have we're getting like targeted um and it's probably because i think there's a lot
(13:42) of goodwill on the channel because we don't sell anything i will never ask you for a whatsapp all right so like please like do not respond to any of the comments that have a picture of me and like some weird decimals afterwards to make it look like it's uh me i will never ask you for whatsapp i will never text you for money all right so please please please please do not respond to those people do not feed uh feed that um but anyways love you all um hope you're amazing uh this felt like the right time to make this
(14:10) video in the parking lot before i go to the gym and keep being awesome and uh if you enjoyed this video click subscribe for a lot more tactical stuff that we do about growing businesses um and growing wealth the point of this channel is there's a lot of people who are broke and i don't want you to be one of them so without further ado akshamosi hit subscribe see you next vic

(00:00) what's going on everyone i'm gonna be talking to you about my fa one of my favorite topics um arbitrage and so the first time i heard this word uh was actually in a fancy dinner i was sitting at and i was like i don't know what's going on and these dudes in finance were talking about derivatives and crazy stuff right they just kept saying arbitrage and i was like what is it you know like like finally i was like what does that mean um and they were like oh it's like when you just take advantage of an inefficiency in a marketplace and i was
(00:26) like how and so then they explained it to me and they're like well it's sort of like when you go on ebay right and you can buy something for five dollars and then you can take the same thing and then just go into amazon and sell it for fifty dollars well that would be a big example but you get the idea where you buy for five and you sell for 50 and it's because there's an inefficiency in a marketplace where there's that's where the arbitrage happens right and so the definition of arbitrage is where you buy in one market
(00:59) right at one cost and then you sell in another market at another cost so you sell high and you buy low pretty simple right everyone understands that that makes shakes that should make sense and here's you in the middle making all your money being happy yeah there's you all right so that is basically what arbitrage means but the more i thought about this concept the more i realized that all businesses arbitrage and how much money you make and the extent to which you you you crush it will be dictated by how big the arbitrage is
(01:32) right even if you think about basic business a service business you're buying labor in the labor market this is market one this is why this is important is that you're buying and selling between different markets all right this was a point of nuance that i didn't understand when they first told me how this worked and i also didn't want to ask because i was embarrassed that i didn't know what i mean so hopefully you can watch this and not be embarrassed if someone says it all right so market one and market two so there's
(01:55) an inefficiency this little line here is the inefficiency between the marketplace what you're buying it when you're selling it right right and so market one can be a labor market you're buying labor at x price and you know that you can sell the labor at another price to market too right and then that's how you make a profit but every business fundamentally works this way i can buy from a manufacturer for a dollar and sell it over to market or market number two for five dollars right now and even the manufacturer buys from
(02:24) raw ingredient producers who buy it from farmers at one dollar and sell it for five dollars right and so that's the game that continue gets played between market one and market two and a a supply chain is literally a series of markets in a row of markets buying and selling buying and selling and buying and selling and then the person in the middle the business owner is technically arbitraging all of these things right right okay now here's where i think this is interesting there are two so take this concept pocket it in your mind for a second
(02:56) and so one of the concepts that i've tried to explain um and i'm i'm partially making this video so that i can i know that i learn things better when i teach them all right so is the difference between economic profits and accounting profits if anyone took economics if you did right then they would talk about this and the difference i'll start with accounting profits because it's it's the easier one to understand they're not hard to understand but it's the easier one all right so economic profits first accounting
(03:21) accounting profits are revenues minus all costs right that is an accounting profit right that's what most of us do when we do our tax returns that is an accounting profit simple everyone should understand that one an economic profit is where you take the revenue minus the explicit cost of doing business and then you also subtract out the opportunity cost which is the implicit cost of using the resources that you have in that particular market or path versus another opportunity so let me give you an example so let's say
(03:57) uh you own a paper mill right and your company owned a forest and that's where they cut the trees down and then they turned it into paper right simple now the economic profits of that business the opportunity cost that would be factored into that economic profit is whether or not you could make more money just selling timber right or selling sawdust or selling wood those would be different examples of things that you could do with the existing resources you have which is this guy in the middle here he's got resources he's
(04:27) got people he's got maybe equipment skill sets talent etc that if he were to apply those skills to a different market he could then make more money and that is the difference between economic profits and accounting profits and the reason this is important to me as an entrepreneur is that when i'm looking at what i want to get into right with what things are interesting to me or for investing because i invest in businesses now which is kind of wild to me um but anyways is that i'm looking is this given these resources of humans and
(04:59) skills and and equipment and software and everything we're currently pursuing arbitrage opportunity a right but what if with these same skills i could have arbitrage opportunity b where i'm buying in this market for rock bottom prices and there's another market over here that is paying top dollar right so between the first example i have where it's a it's a normal amount of money that's being made compared to this arbitrage opportunity i would want to be in this one right now what's going to dictate whether or not it's going to be one of these
(05:38) markets versus one of these markets well the growth of the marketplace overall there are growing markets like online fitness is a growing market right and so it means that there's likely going to be arbitrage a greater degree of arbitrage because there's going to be more demand and so if i can find markets where i feel like there's more demand for the same things that i can buy cheaply then i want to go to those things and so when i'm thinking about all opportunities because i think that that's one of the biggest superpowers
(06:10) that we have to have as entrepreneurs is not sure like right now i could go and run a gym and make money i could i could also run a massage parlor and make money i could also run a supplement company make money i do that too right i could run a lot of different businesses to make money but of all the opportunities under the sun of all the different ways i could make money which is the best given my resources skills talent team etc and then if i look at all of those things on a board these are the things that we're absolutely amazing at
(06:37) and these are the different arbitrage opportunities that exist which of these arbitrage opportunities will be best fit for the skills talents traits team etc that i have and then by answering that question we'll inherently answer the very important question which is what can we be the best in the world at and so i think for me this has been a really valuable concept to understand is that all businesses arbitrage it all functions off of an information advantage between the buyer and the seller the bot sorry the seller always has the
(07:07) information advantage or many times has the information advantage and so fundamentally when you find out that an iphone cost 17 to make people are shocked by this but that's because there's obviously other costs besides the manufacturing obviously but all big businesses run off of extraordinary degrees of arbitrage right facebook is able to have eyeballs and sell eyeballs at a significant amount cheaper than it costs them to manufacture them right right uh verizon it costs them pennies to add another user to their base and so the
(07:41) reason this is important for me to at least express is that for a very long time when i was when i was earlier on in my career i had these weird morals and ethics around how much more i could charge for something and the reality is there is no limit it is simply based on the market demand and so whether it costs you a penny to make something that's worth a thousand dollars or cost you a penny to make something worth two pennies that price that you charge should never be in any way relation to what it costs you and only related to what the market
(08:07) will allow and then it's up to us as entrepreneurs to look at which arbitrage opportunities exist between marketplaces that best fit our skill sets and by doing that we will then find ourselves in the best opportunity vehicle for us to grow in the long term and probably make the most money so anyways i hope that was valuable for you i hope this made sense for me this is a topic that i love talking about um and i hope that you find value in that um and otherwise have an amazing day i'm rooting for you keeping awesome leave a like comment

Transcript:
(00:00) good morning everyone happy monday i hope you guys are had a good restful weekend or maybe not hope you were not resting at all just selling tons of people into remote fitness over the weekend um and hopefully you were um but if you were not then this message is for you so i'm calling this theo [ __ ] moment i was having a conversation with a friend of mine um who's uh in the same space as us and uh he was talking to me about some of the beliefs that he's getting over the phone um with some of the gym owners that he's
(00:26) talking to etc and it was kind of interesting because he was saying that you know these things change week to week um but he said right now everyone's in denial phase he said right now they're in the phase of i'm gonna i'm gonna hold out i think i can wait a couple more weeks for this to be over and i guess i'm here to say that i don't think that's going to work out for you and here's here's why i don't think sitting and waiting is going to work out for you and hoping that when you open your gym it's going to work out i'm calling this the oh [ __ ]
(00:59) moment because right now i think that there's still a certain sense of hope right i think that when they turn the lights back on when they turn the economy back on when they let jim's back which by the way will be last but when they let us go back to business and open our doors you're going to open your doors and i think a lot a lot fewer people are going to come back than you think um and i think that what's going to happen is going to be a slower recovery than most people anticipate because people are still weary etc
(01:28) and i think some people will just like always uh like there's a reason the on-demand economy is the on-demand economy right everyone thought that people i was literally it's so funny i had an internet troll yesterday or two days ago who commented on an ad and literally just saying stupid things uh like stupid like trying to be smart but saying stupid things uh and he was like as soon as online fitness uh as soon as the gym is open back up all this online fitness stuff is gonna go away and i was like really you think that people are just
(01:55) going to choose a less convenient option after they come back he's like well people really value the in person you know blah blah blah right people said the exact same thing about blockbuster against netflix they're like the ceos of blockbuster because it's so easy to rationalize our like human beings don't want to think of bad case scenarios and so we rationalize that we don't need to change right and so blockbuster executives when they were like hey are you concerned about this online streaming stuff they were
(02:26) like no people will always value making a night making an evening going and picking up you know picking out their movie walking inside and getting their candy like it's become an experience and so we think that people will continue to value this experience guess what they were [ __ ] wrong people would rather just click on the couch and do nothing right is the experience of being at your couch better than the experience of shopping at blockbuster i would say no i really miss blockbuster a lot of times but i didn't miss enough to not use
(02:55) netflix or use netflix way more right and so the reality is that people will always choose their convenience and i think what happened very like recently or currently right now is that a huge piece of the marketplace that never otherwise would have tried online training or maybe would have in the next decade it took all of the remote services and dr dragged it 10 years into the future in terms of mass adoption it was forced adoption all right and so i think a large percentage of people are going to say a larger than
(03:24) most gym owners anticipate are going to stay in a remote setting right i think a lot of people are still like their jobs here's the others oh [ __ ] moment is that people some of the companies that did layoffs may not re-hire everyone right because the demand is not going to be what it was at the single greatest moment in economic history i mean like the best economy ever that happened before this and so just like the oh [ __ ] moment is going to be when you turn the lights on and people don't show up right which transparently will
(03:52) be great for me because i'm just going to mark the [ __ ] out of the gyms that want to work with us because like that will be when marketing is more important than ever because you're going to have to differentiate and get your name out there more than anyone else is right um but let's rewind the clock real quick what do you need to do now right what do you need to do now because the airship moment will come now some people have have stronger communities than others right and i always want to put my disclaimer for good operators right if
(04:16) you're an amazing operator and you haven't lost anyone then you'll probably recover better than people who have lost people right because you have a stronger community you have more boarding coaches you have a better culture etc right um but what should you do now so it is my belief and just looking at the math i'm going to do this big presentation for gym lords don't worry uh i did a huge statistical model looking at uh the difference between roi on remote versus roi in person and the question is whether or not you want
(04:43) to be a business owner or a gym owner and that's a very real question like super super real that's a personal question right but if you're in this to maximize making money because i've had tons of gyms who flew out during our vip days and said alex i want to make a million dollars a year and i said it's not going to happen in one gym right now talking heads of gurus will be like you can totally like show me the [ __ ] bank statement all right and then i'll and then i'll believe you right but no i like it's not from one facility unless
(05:09) you have a massive massive facility and typically group training personal training set will be only a part of that right like if you have 6 000 members paying 100 a month like lifetime then sure you can make a million dollars here right but most people didn't invest 5 million dollars into their build out right so it's understanding relative scope okay so in my belief there is no way better than right now to for the best operators to be able to build a million dollar income business two three four million dollar
(05:38) top line business because one we're we're marketing a 25 mile radius and seeing zero decrease in sales percentages all right number one number two our remote gyms right now are closing a higher percentage of leads than they did in person that's a function of one major thing is that they're getting 40 percent of their leads onto it into a sales conversation compared to 20 you know whatever they were doing before all right so they have twice as many at bats and so even if they're not as good on the phone they're not twice as bad
(06:09) over the phone right and so they're a little if you look at right now the average closing percentage is 29 so they're closing 29 over the phone they were closing 42 in person all right but if you get twice as many at bats you actually still net more sales and so number one you can have a bigger geographic radius so the many people that i've talked to says like i want to have a bigger impact here's how you have a bigger impact you can go remote and help people are not in your neighborhood number two lead costs are cheaper not because of
(06:36) the ads the the ad impressions and stuff because that's temporary right um we've already seen it go back to normal so the at the cost per impression is has gone 100 back to normal since two or three weeks ago all right people are advertising you um but it's because when you draw from a bigger radius you get cheaper leads that's just period if you run a an ad nationally it's just as like challenge or whatever you'll get you know 25 cent leads the issue is how do you create trust how do you create a sale or trustworthy environment for a lead to
(07:05) opt in and then buy something on the first phone call right and that's where having um i would consider like the semi-local appeal automatically gives you gives you one or two trust points in your direction which is allowing us to make sales on these first calls but if we're looking at it purely from a math perspective which i would urge you to be a business owner not a gym owner for the moment right now our guys are essentially breaking even on the first transaction right now they're used to making two to one three to one four to
(07:34) one etc on their first transaction right but you are limited by your your capacity to fulfill in terms of how many people you can have at each time you're limited by your lead flow because let's be real like lead flow of a 25 mile radius is always going to be higher and cheaper than in a 5 mile radius because it's quadratic right so if you have a 5 mile radius and then you go from 5 to 10 you didn't double the amount of people that you saw you pied it right so 3.
(08:01) 14 whatever the math is but it's basically let me put in layman's terms if you have a 12-inch pizza and you have a 24-inch pizza a 24-inch pizza is not twice as big as a 12-inch pizza you can fit like four 12-inch pieces inside of a 24-inch pizza because that's how circles work with with with it's called quadratic expansion but anyways um and so when you go to a 25-mile radius you're talking 10 times you know i mean the amount of people that you would be reaching otherwise or 20 or 50 or whatever the math is and so because of that you can have a
(08:26) much bigger reach help more people cons like anybody who's ever struggled with lead flow that doesn't have to happen anymore like you don't have to struggle with lead flow anymore because it's literally enormous and you pretty much can always get lead flow if your target is big enough all right and so putting all these things together cheaper leads bigger geographic radius consistent lead generation a consistent 11 of leads closed which is what we're seeing right now which is higher than most people do in person
(08:51) breaking even on the front end and having 80 percent uh gross margin on the back end like you're talking about spending you know right now if you spend fifteen hundred dollars you'll make six thousand dollars in front end revenue in 30 days that's what the math is right that's the average all right that's the average okay 1500 that's 6600 is the actual number uh of upfront cash in the first 30 days for an online business you know many people have tried to start an online business too many online business gurus there are and the reason
(09:19) they don't have an agency set up or whatever is because they can't guarantee an outcome right they only tow the one or two testimonials that they have of the hundreds of students they have all right i'm giving you the average numbers average average for online so if you wanted to make a six-figure income all right it would take you 30 days to build a recurring revenue stream if you spent uh uh if you spent fifteen hundred dollars it would take if you spent fifteen hundred dollars you closed thirty thirty nine so let's just bump it to make it
(09:51) conservative so if you spent 2 200 in ad spend over the first 30 days you'd be able to have 50 people in your online remote uh business after you lost 44 for not going into continuity all right so i'm accounting for that that you only convert 60 into continuity at 200 bucks a month right that's a 10 000 a month business remote and you can do it in 30 days like averages if you're average you can do it in 30 days right now and so the big question that you have to ask is one am i holding out for what's gonna happen
(10:23) that i don't know about because you don't know what's gonna happen i don't either that's just my guess but like you don't know what's gonna happen but what i can tell you is the opportunity is there and so in the next 30 days in the next 60 days if you wanted to build yourself a six figure or multi-six figure online income you could do it i know that a lot of my gym lords won't do that they're gonna go back to the gyms and that's fine i'm here to serve i'm here to provide whatever value the community that i have asked for
(10:47) but if i were an enterprising [ __ ] which i am i would be strongly considering this it has been very difficult for me to not throw my hat back into the ring and start sonic fitness at large because when i see those types of numbers in terms of acquisition i was like hmm how many sales guys we got i was like i wonder if i i was like i wonder if there's a bunch of gym owners who went out of business so i could just hire to become sales people because when i see that kind of stuff three to one four to one up front you know what i mean ten to
(11:15) one at thirty days ten to one at sixty days sixty days like in gym launch i lose money the first thirty to sixty days right and like i'm just i just know the math game right i'm just willing to make decisions with math if you are able to make decisions with math right now and not let your emotions and not let your fear and not let your discomfort around learning a new skill which is selling over the phone this is the only thing you have to do that's it as long as you acquire that skill set which by the way will set you up better for when you get
(11:41) back to the gym because if you can sell over the phone you convert a high percentage of leads always right if you can just learn that skill you can have an online business simple as that right now and i hope and i and i think my hunch is that that buying behavior will not change people will be now the mass market has been introduced to what online training is like most people don't even know what it was now they know what it is all right and so that that like you're underestimating how big of a deal it is for them to even recognize that industry
(12:11) all right and so one people will now know what online training is number two they will be comfortable more comfortable buying in a remote setting here appreciate over the phone yeah this is after the lights get turned back on because you're like well i don't want to change things you know temporarily because something you know when what happens when you go later what if you have a business that just cash flows later and then you have your gym because many people like uh i won't even get into it but over the phone you would
(12:33) just say yeah you know when covert happened we started doing our first consults over the phone and it ended up just being more convenient for people so we just stuck with it anyways so what's your name why'd you click on the ad right like you can just preface the the sale and then everything else flows like normal right because this has given us the biggest reason of all time the biggest why am i remote why are you doing this over the phone why are we doing this online it has now given everyone permission to have that reason
(12:57) that we never had before right and educated like thank you to the government for educating all consumers on online and remote setting fitness right thank you to the news thank you to everybody for helping us out all right so i say this to say uh i think that for everyone who's holding out and waiting i don't think that's a smart decision um i don't want to be right but i think i probably will be um i think a lot of people are turning the lights back on and a lot of people aren't gonna come back right uh think of this like a
(13:25) vacation it's like all these people are like you know what actually i'm i'm gonna keep doing things at home or you know it's actually kind of more convenient for me to just kind of do it on my own schedule instead of having to go there come back shower all that stuff it was just kind of easier for me because convenience and speed always win with humans always you have to always bet on convenience because we are lazy right and especially when it comes to fitness all right and so it's like well that's why and that's why many people
(13:51) can't market outside of five mile radius because people are too lazy to drive further right they're too lazy you're like but our gym's so great it's like yeah but they're gonna choose a shittier gym that's closer to them just being real right and so if you can take the service to them which we now have the opportunity to learn the skill set to do that you can by the time this thing turns back on probably have more recurring profit profit income than you did before this um but it's for the people who want to win and who want to
(14:16) take action otherwise if you're just going to wait totally cool we'll help you when we want to come back because we we do that too um but uh that's just my that's my two cents right now and i know that whenever i talk about online it's always polarizing but i have a really hard time not speaking my mind about something that i think is more profitable and i think it's lower risk and i think in the post corona economy the businesses that will win are the ones that have lower overhead and have higher margins and have a higher ability
(14:41) to reach customers where they're at and all of those boxes get checked and then you get all the added bonus benefits benefits that i said earlier virtually unlimited lead flow cheaper leads bigger radius higher profit margin you get all of those things on top of everything i said so anyways don't let the airship moment happen to you um take action now uh start selling remote i think it is it is incredibly incredibly incredibly awesome right now um and you should get in all right keeping great catch you soon all right
(15:12) have a great day and uh drop a chat a chat or a light but not a chat drop a comment or like or you know review or something like that if you liked if you didn't then i'm sorry alright catch [Music] you

(00:00) if i want to make a million if i want to make a million pounds next year in 2021 obviously against the market circumstances like what should i be thinking about okay here's how you do it everyone ready so you have to think about units versus ltv so when i talk about growth consulting cash flow consulting i've made you know a handful of videos about it when people pay me 50 grand for six hours i literally break it down to these two core pieces which is how much is a client worth how many do i need to sell right and if you want to do a million
(00:29) gross versus a million net so we just need to be specific here if you're just looking for a million gross then you have your ltv at 10k you need to solve 100 clients right which means you need to sell two clients a week 52 right times two give yourself a little bit of buffer right so and then i just reverse engineer from there so if it's two clients a week and i know that i close one out of five sales calls then it means i need 10 sales calls a week that show and if i know that let's say your average show rate is 75
(00:55) then i'm just going to say 15 so it's at 66 to give myself again at each level i give myself a tiny buffer so that it makes it realistic that i'm going to achieve it so now i need 15 calls a week in order for me to make get 15 calls a week what's my average you know cost per call yours is like five dollars uh but for everyone else you know it's it's a couple hundred dollars but let's say yours is 50 i would say okay i'm going to safely budget 75 right uh and it's 15 calls so that's 22.50 per week in ad spend that i need
(01:26) to spend uh which means that i'm spending you know uh divided by whatever seven is 300 bucks a day right and so for me to get to and how many ads do i need to make to spend a day profitably probably need to make 10 good ads per month and so that means i would block one big calendar day per month to make all the ads and the copy and all that stuff i block out two to four hours a week to review them you know update the copy change you know change creative etc and then three hundred dollars a day yields me my 15 calls 15 calls gives me
(02:02) 10 shows 10 shows gives me two sales and then because of the back end system that i built i know that my ltv is 10 grand and that's the game you

(00:00) what's going on everyone alex from moza here three companies who uh now have done over 110 million dollars in sales and this video i want to talk about the entrepreneurial journey as it relates to control and the reason i think this is so important and this is probably the biggest reason that people get stuck all right and so at the end so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to explain kind of how control shifts throughout the entrepreneurial journey where people get stuck and at the very end of the video i'll tell you
(00:23) basically the the most valuable rule of thumb that i've learned in scaling our companies all right so first thing is the reason entrepreneurship is so difficult is because it forces you to change who you are your identity the values that you supposedly have as you continue to grow i'm not saying your you know honesty etc those types of values but the the way that you see the world and how you operate because in the very beginning you most of us at some point have to transition from a lack of control to complete control
(00:51) right and what i mean by that is either you you know went straight into entrepreneurship where you shifted control from your parents to yourself right or in many other instances you started you had a job someone else was kind of responsible for your income for the most part because they're paying you you weren't generating it yourself and so you're very limited right and then you jump to taking complete ownership over all of your outcomes right and so you have complete control the difficult thing is is that the thing
(01:16) that takes you the first step that huge leap of saying i'm going to be completely in control is usually the thing that will stifle most entrepreneurs who are trying to grow right because if you have complete control and complete ownership that's great but there's only one of you right and so what what that leads to is kind of this this buyback and i think the first time i heard this recently was denmark tell us talking about buyback principle and i just like the terminology but basically you just continue to buy back
(01:41) your time as you continue to grow the company and so in the very beginning most people are buying back support time so it's just kind of like lower skilled support tasks that they're doing in their business so it's like them and then they've got maybe an assistant right and then after that there might be higher level support or administrative tasks so that might be like billing collections contracts all that kind of stuff that might happen in the business after you have like your kind of support role taken care of from there the next level
(02:09) of control that people have to give up is selling right no one can sell like me no one gets it like i get it people just don't relate to my customers right and the issue is control you're trying to control the whole thing and the thing is is that every time you add someone in and you buy back more of your time you relinquish control and so the thing is is that every level of entrepreneurship i'm telling you right now it is always uncomfortable because the thing that you are now holding on to is the thing that you have to give up
(02:36) and this has been one of the hardest things for me a lot of this is because we identify with being the thing right in the beginning i'll give you a simple example because we work so many gyms people be like no one treat trains a class like i do right so that's the first level of fulfillment right first level of of delivery is is training right it's also the first thing they need to outsource and the reason for that is because the market will pay someone 15 an hour somebody will come in for 15 an hour to do that work well if you have
(03:03) work that pays you a hundred dollars an hour then you should be doing 100 an hour or not the 15 hour work but they think because they like to feel special they like to feel unique no one can train like i can train well i mean obviously there's probably some people train a lot better than you so maybe you should let them do the training right and then after that usually the business owner will do contracts billing you know and they're usually not that good at it anyways because they're entrepreneurs and so that's the next thing that
(03:28) happens right and so then the next piece might be some sort of assistant of some kind or some sort of right-hand operator that would help you out right and then again there it's like well no i don't trust anyone with the money if i'm not looking at the money then then we're gonna we're gonna lose well i used to say the same thing until i had someone who's better at tracking the money than i am huh crazy right and so i had to give up control of the money i'm not saying i don't look at it right but i had to give up control of it
(03:52) and so then i'm just selling right because that's the highest value thing i could do at the time was i could just talk to people and get them to give us money right but then eventually there's too many too many consultations that have to happen i still have to run the business right and so i have to give that control over to someone else which is probably one of the biggest and most difficult people this is usually either thing that gets in the way of people going i'd say from a million over so we're doing over a million so
(04:14) up to a million dollars a year you can just sell yourself right like you yourself can sell and you can have these other people who are assisting you but once you cross a million it's usually difficult to be doing the selling yourself and that's where you have to start scaling sales so you have to give that control up right the next level after control of the sales is now you have to teach other people in a group not just one person but a group of people how to sales you have to manage a sales team you have to recruit
(04:37) you have to hire you have to train compensate etc and again that's levels of control but again here here even with the sales team you're talking maybe three maybe 10 million when you get to 10 million trying to go to 30 the level of control that you're giving up here is leadership weird right because there's too many departments too many people you can't lead everyone right so you have to lead a small group of people and get them to lead the people who are underneath of them right and so again it's a level of
(05:04) control it's control over your your culture now obviously you want to lead it you want to lead by example you want to be the the most distilled down version of that thing so that it it permeates right but as you continue to buy back i think the question that i like to ask myself is what am i what am i trying to control what am i trying to control and i think if you think about that and then rather what part of my identity am i giving up by giving up this control i used to think i was you know such a great salesman
(05:32) right no one can sell like i can sell but you know what i can't outsell 12 guys right i i literally can't you know what i mean i can't do it and so and if the business model requires you know only a soup like your level of sales to to make it work then the model's broken right you should be able to have people close half as many as you and still make the model work right now obviously over time you want to get them to sell better than you because all they're doing is selling right whereas you were when you were
(06:02) selling the way you did you were running the business and so with each each of this kind of cycle is you have to give up control and so i told you the beginning of the video that i will give you the rule of thumb that has been served me very well in running my companies which is how far away do you get right how far away do you get when you when you relinquish control because the thing is is you relinquish control but you still take full accountability and responsibility for the results that's what's wild is that you have to say i'm going to
(06:30) give this over to you i'm losing control and yet i'm still responsible that'll trip you up but the rule of thumb that i use is know where the bodies are buried know where the bodies are buried and so what i mean by that is if i don't know where the flaws are in a department i'm too far away so if i'm if you know if i talk to let's say a marketing director or i talk to a sales director i talk to uh you know customer support i talk to you know finance and i don't know where the bodies are buried like i don't know
(07:03) what the issues are because every department has issues every department has problems it's a business it's made of humans and humans are imperfect right which means that there are always imperfections there are things that are not working as well as they could if i can't name problems if i don't know where the bodies are buried in the department then i'm too far away right now when i say that doesn't mean i have given up too much control that's not the issue it's just i need more transparency i need to be paying more
(07:30) attention to that area and this rule of thumb has served me well so if i start hearing only good news from a department and i don't hear anything negative i'm too far away and this has been my my managerial leadership rule of thumb that has really helped me a ton is know where the bodies are buried and so this is the entrepreneurial journey in a nutshell i got a lot of feedback from the zero to 100 million dollar video that i made of kind of the steps from a business model perspective but from the personal perspective the issue is control and
(07:58) that's why most people can't get stuck because they have all these personal issues that prevent them from controlling i'm sorry alex i just don't trust people i have trust issues well get over it because you're not going to build something great without trusting other people so if you want your mom or your dad or the thing that you know you have your trust issues with to be the reason that you're not successful but give them more power go you know power to you right just get just keep giving them control over your
(08:20) life because you have these issues right or you can decide i think this person's done enough damage to me in my life i'm not going to let them stop me from accomplishing what i want i want to accomplish and so i'm going to take back that power i'm going to take back the control over my outcomes take responsibility which may feel shitty in the moment because it means i suck but at least i suck and i don't point at them saying they suck because i can control what i do and as a result i can go through this process and continue to buy back
(08:49) and relinquish control buyback and relinquish control buyback and relay cruise control first of the doing then of the admin then of the the ops then of the sales and then of having a sales team and then of the leadership and then continuing on and on as we relinquish more and more control right how can you be free if you control everything interesting anyways lots of love keeping awesome i'll catch you guys on the flip side hope you found this valuable bye

How To Charge Exorbitant Prices - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFhiK5zORGk

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone in today's video i'm going to show you how to charge exorbitant prices for your goods and services so not that long ago my wife and i were at a charity event for after-school all-stars at arnold schwarzenegger's house and i saw some of the most beautiful displays of understanding market economics um that i've ever seen and so at the end of that night i had my hand raised and i donated a million dollars alone that evening based on the way that they had manipulated the event and so to rewind this story for you
(00:30) briefly um right as i was coming into the event right as people were meeting each other they wanted me to introduce me to some of the other board members of the charities the ceo of the charity ben was talking to one of the other gentlemen there who's a big donor and he said ah what uh what he did and what he what his recommendation was was brilliant and i was so afraid to do it but i'm so glad we did and i was like well what did he say to do he said well last year we sold the tickets for ten thousand dollars uh
(00:54) ahead just to attend the event and play poker he said but this year it was 25 000 and we actually sold more people and i was like that's crazy and the gentleman i found out later had made all of his his fortune in the ultra high-end jewelry business and so that is a business of purely understanding the demand curve supply and demand and how to raise prices and so he said something to me and he said it's so smugly and so like content with himself in this moment that i just it just like etched into my brain he said
(01:22) you always have to remember when demand increases he said you cut supply and he said it just like he said you cut supply and what that does is it jacks prices through the roof because now you have more people who wanted it than before and there are fewer items for sale and so by doing that you get these massively inflated prices which plenty of us probably saw during the the whole pandemic and things like that that happened on some goods that were there all of a sudden demand increased right and so as extension and supply
(01:51) went down and then that is what jacks up prices and the thing is is you can harness that in your own business all right so if you've ever looked at chanel for example if you if you want to buy a chanel bag and these are the best people to look at the people who've been doing this for hundreds of years you know at least 100 years like you know i think don't correct around that but long time right louis vuitton they have figured out they have hacked how to generate and stimulate demand all right so in a channel store
(02:17) for example they have one to two bags that are available corporate doesn't let the stores know how many and of what bags they're going to receive it's a complete mystery complete surprise and they don't tell them when they're going to stop producing stuff and they do it all the time and so what happens is they create this experience where when you walk in the door there's absolute scarcity there because every bag is limited edition there's only one of a kind there might that might be the only bag you ever see you can't even buy these things online
(02:44) and they do that by design so they can stimulate higher prices and so just as a as a quick one on this um i don't know if you've ever really wanted to buy something and you uh you know right as they were about to tell you the price on the thing you got kind of scared just like you know you're exposed because you're like i really want this thing right and all of a sudden they tell you the price and you're like thank god i would have paid so much more than that that is a missed opportunity because you would have paid so much more and as the
(03:10) business owner you need to know how to stimulate that and so i'll tell you one final example and then i'll get into this price curve behind me if i were to sell um a a day of my time for five people right i could probably say tomorrow hey it's twenty thousand dollars for a day there's five of you in the room it'll be intimate click here to buy right sure but what i'm missing is the number one and number two people of those five might have been willing to pay two hundred thousand dollars for that day and so the thing is is as you as you cut
(03:43) cut units so this is supply this is demand this is microeconomics 101. as you cut supply right as supply goes down then what happens is you can look all the way on this demand curve right supply goes down you can raise the price here what ends up happening most times is that people will cut their supply but then they will keep their price uh at a lower price right it's like they'll cut the supply to here but they'll they'll price here rather than pricing all the way here and the thing is is there's so much extra juice in the squeeze that's
(04:11) available for you if you just know this and so my first recommendation for you is if you can create a limited or very scarce service or service level or product that you can release i guarantee you that you will make more money this is the reason and one of the things that isn't taught about this microeconomics demand curve is that they assume a static condition meaning perfect marketplace all people have perfect information and as you shift the price you know that you you try and find the sweet spot but what they don't think take into account is
(04:45) that this demand curve can shift based on marketing so if you think about marketing isn't in a general perspective marketing is artificially stimulating demand you're purposely letting more people know about what you do so that you can generate demand inwards so you can shift your way this way on this on this graph right i'm sorry this one described excuse me and so what we can do here is that if we have stimulated demand demand goes this way right boom it goes all the way down to here which means that our prices
(05:16) we actually can go even further along this curve to increase the price and here's one of the magic things about when you control supply if i were to sell three people that hundred thousand dollar day for example i made a more money than i did selling five people a 20k a day but not only that it's easier for me to fulfill for three people so i create less operational drag i have way more profit right and i create an error of premium and i can also delive over deliver to those clients even more than i could before
(05:46) all right and so if you have a fundamental understanding of how this works the supply demand curve then you can work in your favor and one of the biggest mistakes that i see with most entrepreneurs is that they spend too much time trying to supply and not enough time trying to generate demand demand is the power that's coming towards you stimulate is you satisfying and so you want to think about it like a seductive dance right where you someone someone has this desire right but you want to delay you don't want to satisfy me you want to delay you
(06:14) want to delay right now there is a snapping point where someone eventually feels rejected but it is far far far longer and further away than most people think right and so what you can do is you you tease things you you you flirt with them you whisper things that are coming out you drop these little hints drop these little hints right you create a waiting list right if you had a service and you said hey to work with me i'm all the way over here because i can only take five clients period period and you cap it and you cap it
(06:41) right you have five clients period well i can i can uh i can set you up with a waiting list and i'll let you know when we have more slots you will generate more demand because also the allure around what you do he must be good or she must be good because they have a waiting list because they they are no longer at capacity and so one of the interesting things about being at full capacity is it's completely up to you what full capacity means you can say today that you are full think about that you could say oh we're
(07:07) completely capped out you could cut off your supply to zero right and so as soon as you cut your supply to zero your price shoots that way right and so you cut your supply to zero saying i don't take anyone and then what happens is this pressure builds and it looks it's like a pot right and then you you want to periodically let off the steam you don't want to be letting off the seam all the time because the pressure never builds and that pressure is your pricing power and so to wrap this all up for you the reason
(07:35) it was such a such a tremendous experience for me to see this happen in the real world is i saw them go from ten thousand dollars to ticket to twenty five thousand a second and i saw them sell more right and so by understanding this when you have a limited edition t-shirt and you drop it you will actually sell more units not because this curve is wrong but because the way you marketed it by creating scarcity shifted the demand curve in your favor people who might other not otherwise buy or say i'll buy later now feel forced to buy and by extension
(08:04) we can jack our prices and actually end up selling more units overall and so to wrap this up for you one if you can create an ultra high very very very scarce very very small supply type service or good or product i guarantee you'll sell for more money you'll get more people to buy it and i think that if you just do that in your business in some way you will see this power harness to your advantage and you'll see the pricing and profit around these things and you'll never want to go back so hope you enjoyed this click subscribe
(08:33) and i'll see in the next video

What I Would Do If I Had My Gyms (Do This in 2020) [ALEX HORMOZI] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ktgTBNlg7M

Transcript:
(00:00) i would rather have a solution that i can get uh ninety percent of the marketplace to get an 80 win rather than have five percent of the marketplace get a hundred percent win i uh slept like uh a cherub which is a small angel baby uh last night my gosh i feel like a human being um and so i wanted to bring you a question that layla asked me yesterday and i thought that would be a good podcast topic she was like what would you actually do like right now you're like well like if you had if you were you know roll back the
(00:29) time clock and this had happened when we had our six uh gems like what what would your actual what would you do to uh approach this and what would your play be and so i wanna i wanna first uh just at least say with my big disclaimer here is that uh something that i don't discuss a lot but i think is worth mentioning is that the advice that i give in general um i try to cater to the audience that i'm speaking to um if i ran a gym i would probably run it somewhat differently than what we espouse and that is because i am not you
(01:01) and you are not me and so i would rather have a solution that i can get uh ninety percent of the marketplace to get an 80 win rather than have five percent of the marketplace get 100 win um and i've run my business that way and i think that is why we've been uh really successful is because it's the same thing with like a weight loss program like if i can get if i could get you know 90 of people to have a great result uh rather than you know 10 of people to have a crazy crazy result then i would rather serve the 90. um elon
(01:34) musk even talks about this he's like i'd rather do a good amount for a ton of people rather than a lot for a very small amount um and so we've taken the same approach in terms of how we uh you know like when we make offers all my focus is like how can i make the best offer that anyone can sell right um how can i make a sales process it's so easy anyone can do it not necessarily like like for me i'd be selling high ticket over the phone all day long right but a very small small segment could actually do that successfully at scale so that's my first
(02:03) disclaimer now that being said this is exactly what i would do um if my gyms you know were were in the midst of this uh you know coveted stuff so first off uh i would get out of the leases that i have now independent of of because there's some people were like well we're going to get out of this sooner we're going to have this later i have no idea but what i know is just opportunity if i have the opportunity to to to flip my facilities in an environment where i'm being encouraged by both government and my uh clients to make the flip and
(02:38) remain open uh then i'm going to take that opportunity and flip to a more profitable model right like we're giving we're being given permission in this instance to do that with zero repercussions it's even being encouraged and so the first thing is i would take all six i have my recurring base of members and i would flip them to remote now then i would try and cut um all of the rent uh for each of those locations maybe even get out of the lease i would likely just try and negotiate three to six months of free rent see how it
(03:06) shakes out but likely um this is what i'm saying i would do you don't need to do this all right i'm saying like this is how i would this is how i would play my cards all right and so what would happen is let's say each of those gyms is at 30 000 a month right uh in recurrent just efts not running cash flow nothing else not supplement just like they're doing 30 000 a month cool so now i've got 180 000 a month that i have in recurring now let's be realistic let's say 25 of those people drop off because it's not an
(03:34) owner operated facility i've got staff they don't care as much they're not rubbing bellies and kissing babies the way i would if i were at a single location um and so let's say i lose 25 so that means i lose roughly you know 45 000 off that um i think no 40 yeah right 40-ish right so there's 40 thousand on that so now i'm down to like 140-ish or 135.
(03:59) uh per month that's my recurring nun okay there's a lot of cash there all right then i would take my best trainer at each facility the guy the guy or gal who cared the most who was the most engaged with members who was the most upbeat the most positive um and truly cared about uh keeping them and i might have to take two at each facility if there's too many for one person to handle that's fine uh the rest of my personnel would be considered non-essential because in this new model they would not be able to provide value right that's what i would do all right
(04:27) so i've got let's see we got six that means i've got 12 staff that i'm keeping on to maintain a hundred and thirty five thousand dollars in recurring revenue per month now let's say conservatively i pay each of these people three thousand dollars a month right just stay at home now that's a great for some of these guys that might actually be a big pay jump from what they were doing in person cool so now they're making 3 000 a month staying home to just provide accountability all right that is it so big big thing here
(04:56) now like at gym launch what we're doing is we have um we just so i'm kicking this off today uh starting on monday we're running 16 remote workouts per day basically every hour during the normal work day uh there's gonna be a class that's being held and that way all of our gyms can cut their overhead and just have all of those workouts as fulfillment for their online clients right and so now they don't even have to staff that stuff it's already been taken care of centrally by all of us all of our gyms can participate that cut their over even
(05:25) further right now rewind back to the six gyms so step one i'm gonna get out of the leases that i can because because right now uh you have a pretty good opportunity to be able to break leases uh and or at the very least get three six months of free rent uh right now so that's one two i would flip um my my recurring revenue into uh remote which would be nutrition and accountability primarily i'd have the the workouts that are being done if i have 12 trainers i can say each of you guys are responsible for one workout a day that's it that's one every
(05:55) hour and that allows all of my people to participate in a session at any given time but it's not that hard because each of them can do it from home right and the whole point is that like i'd love to say it's going to be from the gym but reality if you're getting quarantined you might not be able to even go to the gym so and most of the clients are even consuming this from their homes and so it makes sense to have a trainer that's from home not a big deal so that's that's what i have on the workout part big big caveat here no one cares about
(06:19) the workouts if you're selling over the phone you can get workout apps online you know like uh you know beachbody and kayleitzin's got a sweat app like there's all these other apps that are like 10 to 20 a month that have probably better already pre-existing stuff so you're not going to win on the work out front right you're going to win on the accountability and the service that's how we've always won and that's how we need to keep like remember the rules haven't changed your workouts never mattered they don't matter now right
(06:44) what matters is the relationship that you have these people that they feel like someone is checking in on them right they pay for you to pay attention that's how it works all right so i have my 12 trainers let's say i'm paying them 3 000 a month so i'm paying 36 000 a month in overhead for those trainers right and the only thing they have to do every day is one workout and then reach out to the customers so make sure that they are uh being taken care of making sure that their head space is good making sure that they're not going to
(07:10) the pantry and rating it and getting cookies every day make sure making sure that they attend one of the workouts that is what they do all day now that's it that's all they have to do all right now overnight by doing this i have a hundred thousand a month that's left over in all profit holy smokes that's a pretty good deal but wait now what do i do with my time right so my time would be focused um the other thing that i would ask them to do is uh i would dedicate their first two hours of the day every day to doing 100 cold
(07:42) reach outs all right they want to pay for themselves cool 100 cold reach outs what you do is if you have someone who who's who's interested you book them on my calendar i'll close them all right so i'm going to fill my day up with uh appointments that my team my 12 people doing reach outs are gonna set for me all right and then i'm gonna close beyond that um i'm gonna start turning on cold traffic and i'm gonna run because right now in this hypothetical environment which is the real environment currently uh lead costs are like 50 to 75 off it's
(08:14) nuts right i've never seen anything like this it's crazy um and so we would be scheduling uh phone calls to sell and so my trainer's day looks like this first two hours of the day all they're doing is doing cold reach outs they get their daily 100 in you give me a hundred reach out that's what you owe me all right get me one schedule today i don't care just give me one schedule today all right what are they gonna say they're gonna say hey name do you know anybody who's trying to stay in shape during the quarantine who doesn't want to get make
(08:42) turn their sweatpants into yoga pants by the end of this ha right whatever now when you say that all of a sudden the people who are responding are like oh this person's not fishing they're asking genuinely if i know anybody right and now more than ever people have a lot of good will that they want to help out other small business owners like that is definitely the zeitgeist of this moment zach has a german word for the general vibe of an era um anyway so people are trying to help out small business owners so if you're asking like that you're not
(09:05) even soliciting them you're just saying hey do you know anybody and a lot of times i'm like you know i i'm trying not to lose weight perfect or gain weight perfect let's get you booked for a call we have a totally remote thing to make sure that you stay healthy etc right so their first two hours they're doing the daily reach outs then they're doing all the recess to their existing customers that they're maintaining right and then one hour of the day they're uh required to do their workout now most of the time you'd want to have your your
(09:27) trainers are working out anyways at home so it's like just record it like have fun with it right and then that way all of my people can actually have more sessions than they ever had in person so i'm adding value then from what i used to have they have more availability than we've ever had they have more variety because they probably have access to trainers that they couldn't have had access to before all right and it's also my best coaches so it's like you know we all know we've got a couple coaches who run stuff and if somebody use news
(09:51) coming in you probably want to put them with jessica and not eric right you're like no jessica's awesome don't put in eric's as her first session right maybe maybe save that for some of the later people who already like us right so those are the trainers who are going to be getting those at-home workouts big picture again big reminder no one cares right no one cares about the workouts they only care about the accountability all right so if i flip my gyms right i renegotiate my leases i push them out or i break them i
(10:15) take my recurring i would get into 100 remote i would let go of not essential personnel or not who are not generating revenue or keeping revenue through fulfillment right they're generating revenue in their first two hours a day by getting new calls the rest of their day they're focused on doing the fulfillment for the for the clients that they already have in maintaining that eft and recurring um they're feeling back the bucket because i'm going to be doing the sales because in in a time of strife i'm going to do
(10:39) what i need to know how to do best and make it rain right and so the people who are not going to be able to succeed are the ones who don't want to roll up their sleeves and get dirty if you're the best salesman at your gym then you should sell that's what you should be doing right and then they do their one workout a day so that's what trainers have to do three things reach outs to to to get new customers reach out to existing customers make sure they know we're paying attention and then finally that they're doing one workout a day
(11:01) which they should be doing for themselves anyways they're just gonna record it awesome box is checked all right my day is gonna be making sure that we're marketing and filling the bucket back up all right that's it that's my day all right so i'm marketing and taking sales calls i'm taking sales costs from paid traffic and taking sales calls from from outbound i'm taking sales calls all day long that is what my job is to make it rain and feed the machine all right that is what i would have done um if i had been in
(11:25) that situation or in this situation i'm not necessarily saying you do that i'm telling you what i would have done and that would be the play that i would do because it would give me permission to overnight transform six facilities into one massive recurring revenue stream that's 100 remote that is higher higher profit margin for fulfillment and i will say what i said yesterday but i'll say it again so hopefully it sinks in is that just because this has changed does not mean it's bad right eight months ago i walked through
(11:54) all the math about why having a remote fulfillment is a better solution there's a reason people like going online right there are better margins right there are the thing is is that a lot of people felt like for some reason that that was bad that's okay but now people are being forced to do it doesn't mean it's bad it actually makes more money and now we're getting permission from the government and from society to do this for ourselves so i would take that opportunity and uh run with it so that's my rec not my recommendation excuse me
(12:21) that's what i would have done uh you can take that for which you will but that is exactly what i would have done step by step that's how it broken out my trainers that's what i would have done with my overhead that's what i would have redefined their responsibilities as and then beyond just lead them through the crisis um i would also try and paint a vision or for a better future it's like guys you liking this you're staying at home you can work out whatever you want um you're just actually getting people good results because we're making
(12:44) sure that they're just staying accountable and they need us the most right and um one small note that i want to add to this when you're selling or when you're talking to customers everyone right now is at the airport so if you've noticed everyone at the airport is always just like immediately a three out of ten three out of five stressed right they're already at six out of ten stress levels what people want is to feel good all right and so that's gonna and so when you get on the phone if you wanna sell right you gotta make them feel good like
(13:15) the fundamentals have not changed it's just you got a little bit more resistance when you're starting because they're already at a negative point they're not at neutral most people are now going to be a little bit negative because they're quarantined they got their kids around they feel like they're smelly they're you know they feel sloppy and bloated because they're eating cookies all day right and uh you know they're uncertain about the future what they want from you what your employees want from you what your
(13:37) clients want from you and what your prospects when you get on the phone with them want from you is one word hope all right so you have to be the hopefulest that exists all right and the way that you have hope is that you have optimism about what you are willing to do to endure and as long as you know that you're willing to endure just about anything to get through this then you have confidence and certainty in the fact that you will get through this and you can you can uh convey that conviction to your prospects to your
(14:07) team and to your to your customers because that's what they're going to want like right now therapy is blowing up life coaching is blowing up in terms of like growth tons of people want life coaches tons of people want therapists right now because they're stressed out of their minds and so if you're looking for more ways to provide value someone will buy after how you've made them feel from the first 15 minutes of the phone call the first 15 minutes is just like caring about them throwing them some love making them feel good about like hey
(14:35) we're going to get through this no worries right they want to be around more of that they want more of that feeling the fact that you're going to sell them weight loss and that's going to be the vehicle that you monetize is almost secondary to how you will make them feel in that moment because they're just going to want to feel more of that and so that goes for your trainers reminding them dude like we're just trying to make people feel good right now all right we're trying to get people through this like if we can get them to
(14:58) put down the cookies and move a little bit they're probably going to feel better and if that's what that's what our value is right now then that's what it's going to be all right so that is what i would do step by step um if i have my gym drink covered right now um i make no recommendations you are all grown as individuals and make your own decisions for yourself but that is what i would do so anyways hope you have an amazing wednesday keep rocking you can make it through this um you just gotta want it all right lots of love catch you
(15:21) guys soon [Music] you

#1 Lesson for Young Entrepreneurs from $100M CEO | Alex Hormozi - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTgJ0mQi0uU

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i think one of the best things about entrepreneurship is the lessons that we learn from failure right and i try and share as many as i can uh on this on this you know vlog podcast etc um because i think that if i can help you not have the failure to learn the lesson then you can get the lesson without the scar that being said one of the hardest things is learning the right lesson from failure and so let me let me unpack that because i think it's one of the most profound things that we as entrepreneurs or just we as people
(00:28) have to learn is making sure that we're we're getting the right takeaway so let me give you a couple different examples to show you the wrong takeaways um and then kind of maybe walk through a framework that might be useful so let's say uh you know you're in middle school and you're dancing with someone of the opposite sex or whatever you're attracted to whatever right you're dancing with someone you like and uh i'll just use the guy girl example because that's what i'm used to so it's like let's say i'm dancing with
(00:52) a girl and uh and she she breaks my heart whatever right if i said ah girls aren't for me right girls don't work right that would be ridiculous right of course it would be it would just mean that that didn't work in that one instance but if i took the wrong lesson from it then i might swear off women all together right and what's interesting is that that's an incredibly ridiculous example but people do it every single day right it's like a business owner who hires an employee and the employee doesn't work out and says ah
(01:22) employees they all suck they're not for me right it's learning the wrong lesson from the failure and so i think it's just as dangerous maybe even more dangerous to learn the wrong lesson because now you have a story that you've told yourself that reinforces the incorrect lesson and then from that point going forward you you operate under this false guise this false belief that you've told yourself that you believe is right because you have experience right and just because you have experience doesn't mean we took
(01:49) the right lesson from it and so i'll tell you one that's uh that's been really that's been really interesting for me to learn um is over the last uh you know over how many years right i have succeeded a lot based on inbound marketing all right so that means paid advertising to generate demand in inwards right and what's interesting about that is a lot of my successes come from it but what's interesting is that i think that i've had a really long-term perspective when it comes to my health right health and fitness like
(02:20) when i work out and how i eat i've always tried to pick really sustainable things that i can do forever right and i've been in pretty good shape for you know almost almost 20 years um and so that's that's been a successful action that i've been able to repeat over and over again to the same degree my marriage is actually probably one of the better things that i've done i picked that rationally my partner laila and we both said we want to go this way we have this mission we have these values and we'll figure out the love stuff as
(02:50) we go and we actually got married before we were really in love um mostly just because we thought we were so aligned and we've learned the love and every year it's actually gotten better and that was a rational decision that was made by you know by both of us but and it was based on long-term thinking but what's interesting is that i've like been able to observe my own actions uh over the last decade you know in business and i actually even think that i've still been more short-term skewed in my thinking because of the thing that i got really
(03:20) good at which is inbound and inbound you can immediately gen you can snap your fingers and make money tomorrow and you can make a tremendous amount of money in a very short period of time and i think in some ways i may have learned the wrong lesson from my early success which is success should come big and should come fast right for me right because that's that's my own it's for my own belief and um as i look at the things that i've done that i've done really well for a long period of time none of them follow
(03:49) that that path right and so i've been you know strategically or deliberately kind of deconstructing my beliefs around what i think success should look like and what growth should look like and i'm finding myself more and more trying to move in the direction of sustainable growth which i remember hearing when i was younger and being like ah that's horse crap but now as you know i feel like i've gotten more scars and more experience i actually think that if you're really looking on an endless horizon which is what i try to shift myself towards
(04:19) then you only do things that you think are worthwhile and your obsession my own obsession with the hurry and the rush you know i would love to say disappears but at least it decreases right because if you're like you get from the finite to the infinite you go for the can i do this until i die i know that what i do in fitness i can do until i die i know that you know the way that layla and i run our marriage i can do till i die like the way that we we've we've we've done this we can do so i don't know you might
(04:45) be like oh you've only been married for five years sure maybe yeah maybe like maybe maybe i'll have to keep saying this and then it's like you've only been married 10 years only been married 20 years i don't know we'll see right but it feels the same long-term way the way the other ones did because we have there's way less volatility it's just a slow and steady progress and so when i think about what i like how i'm trying to build things now it's different right uh in the beginning it was just like short hard fast like let's go let's go
(05:12) let's go um and i feel like now as i've gotten more experienced or more weathered it's more like okay this is our current growth rate can we just sustain this right because if we if we can just sustain this for 10 years we'll be at 100 million plus we'll be at 200 million plus if we just do this and what that's forced me to do is is increase the time between my thoughts and my actions which entrepreneurship is so interesting because you have to kind of unlearn some of the things that got you started in the beginning you can't do anything
(05:44) because you're so paralyzed so you do need to decrease some of the time because you start taking action right but at a certain point you start becoming so good at taking action that you end up breaking things right so you actually have to start increasing that time and what that does is it gives you more space to make decisions that are in a that are rational instead of emotional and so that's when you see a competitor run an ad or you see an employee leave with clients or whatever happens and you want to have
(06:06) some reaction and most times no reaction is the best decision and this is just like it's been this repeated trend that i've had and so my current the current lesson that i'm trying to see is is actually not from failure but making sure that i learned the correct lesson from my success um and thinking it might have actually been bad for me that i was that i was so successful so early on uh and it might have been that i took the wrong strategy from it and so what i the things that i'm trying to build now are far more enduring
(06:40) uh and more stable and do not require me or my skill at all and by doing that i feel like i'm getting closer to the first time in my life where i actually have businesses that truly run without me um like actually not as in like oh i don't do the day to day that's definitely one level and one component of it but when it can get to the point where it truly grows without me and i'm really just there to guide direction and be a sounding board for the leadership team that's in place i feel like that's that's where
(07:12) i should go um and i feel like the things that i'm building now are in alignment with that and it's been it's taken years to get here um and so anywho my goal is if you are if you are in it and you're not growing as as fast as you want but you are growing then extrapolate that over 10 years right extrapolate over five years and say can i just grow at 10 every every every quarter that's huge growth right can i just do this every quarter can i just make this sustainable can i make this consistent because what i'm seeing is the richest people in
(07:47) the world just look for reliability they look for low volatility which means less of this and so if i can decrease the volatility of the business by making things more consistent and not going for the big the big win that's like right there right and i just stay patient um it continues to pay dividends and so that's kind of the chapter that i'm in right now um in the lesson that i'm trying to learn or or walk uh and so i figured i would just share that with you and also just the thought process around looking at your successes and your
(08:17) failures and making sure that you learn the right lessons from them because i've definitely taken lessons from my successes that that were not that were not correct and i've taken lessons from my failures that were not correct and each each of them is equally dooming or damning right and a fun final thought that i'll leave you with is what if everything that you did when you were successful was not because of you but because of outside forces and everything that you've done to fail was your fault i've taken this perspective and tried to
(08:49) apply it to my life and i've had an amazing amount of inferences and thoughts that have gone around it that have been completely new so it's like what if what if when you were successful that one time maybe it wasn't because of you at all maybe it was just maybe it was just chance right maybe it's just coincidence and i think a lot of times we apply those frameworks to other people but never to ourselves so someone does something bad we say it's their fault something good happens if we don't like them we're like oh that was because they got
(09:12) luckier only because of this outside circumstance that wasn't because of them but we never apply that to ourselves and i think that if we do if you reverse it because we always want to say we take credit for our for our wins and we say our losses are because of outside circumstances but if we flip that a lot of times i think you get some really interesting lessons that can come from it and just just walking through the thought process what if this wasn't because of me what other things happened that didn't line up for me
(09:36) that were not my doing and by doing that you'll start to you'll start to see different trends and different patterns then maybe you cannot you can you can take advantage of opportunities when they aren't because of you but you can still take advantage right and so anyways i wanted to share this thought process with you for me it's been incredibly valuable um and i hope it is valuable for you too so uh enjoy and i'll see in the next [Music] [Applause] you

My Address To The Gym Industry At The Onset of COVID - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tF3ODk56hg

Transcript:
(00:01) gym owners uh happy monday hope this uh video reaches you at a good time wherever you're at um this is uh i think this is a very important video that i want to make uh it's been on my mind for probably the last month or two um but it became apparent to me that we needed to um clearly state our position it starts with context of where the industry is at right now and then kind of how uh jim launch sees ourselves best supporting the industry and uh gym owners within it so right now as i see it from the various sources
(00:34) that i've collected 25 to 30 percent of all independent gyms have permanently closed i believe and i said at the very beginning that i thought it would be to 30 but i think i was wrong i think i underestimated how many more gyms would actually not be able to stay in business and so i think that number may climb over the next six months to maybe 40 or even 50 percent of independently owned and operated facilities the reason um that i wanted to start with that is that in the world of investments in finance they have a saying which is
(01:10) in a if you have can pick between a strong operator and a week in a weak market or a strong market with a weak operator in both cases the market wins which is you can be the best you know entrepreneur in the world but if you're trying to figure out something that helps newspaper companies you're probably not going to succeed because newspapers are going out of business and i'm not saying that gyms are newspapers that's not my point the point is more so that just to illustrate growing versus static versus shrinking
(01:41) markets so where do i think the market is going i think the gym industry has a very very rough next year ahead i think that the vast majority of consumers as i said earlier have already had the opportunity to switch to different fitness vehicles i think that the brand of fitness that we have to offer right now given the constraints in the political environment and what we are forced to do whether right or not are our massive constraints on the business right we cannot create the experience that we have wanted to create for our customers we
(02:19) want to create a memorable experience for them and i don't think that the constraints that are there give us that opportunity i also think it creates tons of variability in workforce and labor because we cannot predict uh how if we're going to get shut down again or if it's going to reopen or if there's going to be a spike or there's going to be a new constraint or we have to do temperature thermometers or this type of mask or they have to you know all of these different things massively weigh into and i don't know if
(02:46) you've just to illustrate this for you personally i am not going out to eat at restaurants nearly as much mostly because i just don't feel like dealing with the hassle and i think that that is true amongst many people who are looking at coming back to service-based facilities right now if you're looking at you know if you're a woman and you're trying to get your nails done or you've got your hair done or any of those types of things go in and ask them how business has been right they have the same constraints
(03:11) that you know jim has and many of those people would like to go back and have that desire and yet they have not and so i think what we've done or what what's happened in the marketplace is that we've permanently trained consumers uh to consume or fill this need in a different way and i think just by nature of you know from zero to a hundred if if we had a hundred percent of our clients before this if all of those clients are introduced to a new type of service or a new solution for this need an amount greater than zero
(03:39) will stick with that and so i i think that the market overall uh is shrinking and will continue to shrink for the foreseeable future so um to put this statement open and clear gym launch is loyal to gym owners we are not loyal to gyms my goal is to equip everyone here in this community with the best opportunity vehicle to package their skills to be able to provide for their families and be able to serve their communities in a way that makes them healthier that has been the goal since day one gyms at the time for the last three four years has
(04:15) been a vehicle for that individual which when put together with you know the gym launch system creates a profitable business for the gym owner and creates a superior experience for the customer and helps people get healthy which is the goal to that end gym launch as a company will be pivoting and that is because i believe that the best opportunity for gym owners is remote for a variety of reasons i think that first off from a lead generation standpoint for most small businesses lead generation is the hardest thing
(04:49) in a remote environment or an online environment you have virtually unlimited lead generation you will never fatigue the united states's need for weight loss you won't even fatigue a 50 mile radius for weight loss but a five mile radius is definitely possible right it's much more difficult and i can tell you this right now firsthand on the glx side the people that we're working with for in person versus remote uh they they cycle through the copying creative at three to four times the rate it burns out much faster so there's more effort that has
(05:20) to go in for a lesser volume result at a higher cost uh and the the lead costs if you just think conservatively if 30 of people are not going to like people already have excuses to not going to the gym when they have no constraints but if you add even a little bit of friction towards something that they already kind of don't want to do then that constraint may double and that's pretty much what we're already seeing the lead cost on average across all the markets for in person is about 30 for many people that does not and that's
(05:49) for a free offer right not even paid right that's average now some people might be better some people worse but this is just on average what we're looking at and so when we take these things into account right we can get way more leads at a way lower price with less effort and more consistency factor one factor two the model itself how difficult is it to implement how much margin remains for the business owner uh how does it enable the business owner's lifestyle uh in an online setting or remote setting the business owner can move and
(06:26) live wherever they want they don't have to be in a single area they can have freedom with their family they don't have to show up at the gym at four o'clock in the morning they don't have to be there until nine o'clock at night they don't have to drive in for an appointment to have that person no show and then have another one at seven o'clock at night that they just sit there and wait for right a lot of those things that we've had to deal with as gym owners and small business owners in a brick and mortar setting
(06:50) no longer has to exist all right and very frankly i have always wanted to figure out a way to make online work at scale why because you're no longer geographic constrained you're far less temporally constrained and financially the model is more profitable period and as a like just from the business setting that would probably be enough for me but on top of that many people achieve superior results in a one-on-one setting compared to a group workout setting right many of you have hired tkn have worked with trevor have worked with
(07:29) an online coach whether on the strength side or the nutrition side or body composition or whatever and you did that because you knew the one-on-one attention allowed you to get a better result right if you had to change someone's life and you if they signed on and somebody in your family were going to die what way would you train them if you had the option of group workouts or one-on-one coaching online if you had to which one would you do because if you say group workouts but then you'd start doing the one-owner
(08:00) nutrition that's not the model that's not the question the question is which would you because that is realistically what we're offering in the marketplace all right and so i already said there was enough of a case from a business standpoint to make that argument but on the fitness component side i believe that the actual fulfillment is better for the end user and is more profitable on top of that you have fixed margins in the business you do not necessarily need to have rent now if you have to deal with the fact that you have rent then
(08:25) that's a separate issue but the business model itself is not constrained by the sunk cost of decisions that have been made in the past and the reason that i did not have an online business model until covett hit was one because we didn't have to but two because no model that i could find and i looked at everyone's out there could be done at scale by anyone without a superior skill set without having an authority or having a following or requiring an inordinate amount of effort for example there are three primary models that
(09:01) exist in online today excluding the glx model that i'm going to talk about vehicle one outbound messaging right we have the cold messenger training i bought two or three ten thousand dollar courses i took all the best findings and i put it into a course for 37 right you guys all have access to it fundamentally why is it not something that i see is enormously valuable because it requires effort right simply put you have to spend two three four hours a day outbound messaging people does it work yes does it require a ton of effort yes can you
(09:36) scale that not really right and so that is opportunity vehicle number one and if you've seen all the gurus over the last 70 years the reason none of them have an enormous business is because the vehicle is not that good it's okay right with an okay vehicle you can build an okay business all right so that's vehicle one vehicle two is doing a webinar so it's building out a sales presentation that edifies you generating traffic online to register for the webinar watch the webinar pushing to an application that they then
(10:05) schedule a call with you so you can do a two thousand three thousand dollar plus sale typically those models do not make a ton of money one because the webinar is fatigued two because the cost per application is extremely expensive you're looking at 100 applications many times three some of the people who are who i know in that space who are experienced only get one to one two to one up front on their ad spend with a high ticket sale and that's the people who know what they're doing that doesn't seem like a model that i
(10:35) would scale to others third model is doing an online challenge model what that means is not the way that we're talking about it but they do group challenges so that's where you tell everyone to sign up for a group it's a five-day challenge you make content day one through four and then you make a pitch on day four and try and get a pitch on day three it doesn't matter the point is is that you're trying to solicit people from a free group where you provide value where you're somewhat edified to then get on the phone with
(10:59) you to buy some stuff right and that model is again a very effort effort based model it's very stop and go it's very clumpy um and in my opinion it's very difficult to scale which is why you don't see any massive online weight loss companies that just do these five day online challenges and i'm going to say massive i'm saying real massive not like small personal biases i'm saying real big businesses and so because of that those are the three models that i saw that existed for people who did not have a following
(11:29) and it was not a consistent acquisition model and so i could not put my weight behind it because i knew that if i were to implement one two or three or all three of those together the vast majority of the people in our community would not succeed period it is what it is all right so the reason i like the model that we have now is that after all the trial and error that we've been able to create we can start a new business which is essentially what this is overnight because in a semi-regional marketplace so if the
(12:00) same state is you you have a certain amount of trust that exists with a free trial front end it does not require a tremendous amount of skill in order for you to sell it or scale the sales to someone else try and outsource a three thousand dollar high ticket fitness sale you're not going to be able to do it well i can promise you all right if you're having trouble outsourcing a 200 sale try a three thousand dollar sale it's not going to happen all right so the front end we know that the acquisition is easier because we have
(12:31) unlimited leads that's massive for consistency of business operations and for consistency of cash flow all right on the sales side or so on the lead nurture side allen has already solved this problem at scale up to this point you couldn't get 800 leads a thousand leads a month and have any any any dream of being able to work that lead flow without two to three full-time people not gonna have it right with alan we can do that and we can set the price at fixed so you always know what it costs to get a new customer right on the phone
(13:03) period for the sale itself for a free trial sale someone with very very low skill set can still sell a free trial on the phone it is such a low risk offer and so the magic of the model is the fact that we have now found out after this whole community has tried and tested it that the trainerized app that we've built out my accountability right when paired with a free trial person in the model that we espouse which is supplement sale number one and then abandon hope number two right both of those sales are easy enough that you can
(13:35) scale them and break even or come close to it on the first transaction and then by day 30 you will be able to convert those customers at the same price as you were able to before in a gym setting except you have far more of them you acquired them for less and they're staying at a higher profit margin you no longer have to do sessions there's no rent that you're that you're you're forced to do and ultimately there are many of you who over the last month have built out three or four thousand dollars a month recurring revenue that's in 30
(14:03) days right for those of you like marcia and hopefully didn't mean to call her out here she's built up 40 000 recurring revenue rawls built out another 40 000 in recurring revenue and she's been doing it as well all right this model if you give it one month two months three months four months it is going to be far superior to the the revenue and profit that you were able to make at the gym except it has no signs of slowing down right you do not have to be constrained by your geographic uh five mile radius if you've had the desire to impact your
(14:36) community in a much bigger way if you've had the desire to not be constrained to the five miles around the location of your gym that's only uh valuable to you when your ads are converting because you have the combination of ads copy and creative and placements that are actually working in this specific market at that time with the promotion made which is real talk how it works right if instead of having all that you can virtually have an unlimited front end and all you have to do is tweak the skills on the back end that you can
(15:04) consistently create because there's only three roles that exist in the model the person who sells the trial up front the coach and that's it right and there's you as the owner and so as long as you and if you wanted to at scale you could have one person just all three right um but the point is is that each of these roles getting someone to sell free trial is not difficult getting someone to convert on a same-day offer they don't even have to pay on that day which is like hey normally it's 59 today it's 49. you don't have to say
(15:32) yes right now or so you don't have to pay right now just say yes right now you want to use the card java file many people can make that sale for the nutrition hey don't need to buy all these things i changed you get this stuff to get started right great most people can make that sale these sales are not complicated but can be done at absolutely massive scale and retain a customer at a 2 000 price point where you can acquire them in high volume very consistently all right and so i need everyone so i wanted to at least clarify this for
(16:01) everyone in terms of where jim watches position is in this marketplace we are going to be serving gym owners and we're going to be serving gym owners in the way that we know best and we're going to align ourselves with the model that's going to make them the most money and very transparently i'm going to be doing this because i believe that i would like to serve a marketplace that's going to grow and make the most money because the more money you make the more money i make and you know that i'm a capitalist
(16:23) at heart and always have been transparent about my intentions right my goal is to run a profitable wildly profitable business that grows fast right and so to that end if i'm in a b2b space i have to align with a model that i believe has the highest likelihood of success and profitable growth for my customers and so for the foreseeable future that is where gym launch is going to be focused we're going to be focused on bringing the online revenue to everybody here and i can tell you that if you have been on the fence it is not going to get
(16:56) easier if you're if you're if you're clinging to in person it is not going to get easier now is there anyone in this marketplace that i believe is better at running in person no why because they all bought my book to try and build their whole temp coaching program right like the business the business mentality the business models behind that system are running in parallel we're using the exact same skill sets the exact same choreography of sales the only thing that's changing is that we're filling through an app instead of in-person
(17:23) workout that's it that's all that's changing and so if you have the same five thousand dollars to spend on marketing if you spend that same five thousand dollars in for online clients you will make more money simply put it is easier right now to get 50 new online clients than it is to get 50 in person clients and i don't see that trend changing any time for the rest of 2020 right and it and the thing is is what i do feel is known is that the rest of 2020 is going to be for gyms in general what is unknown is whether 2021 is going
(17:57) to get any better and so it's i feel like i've been i've been holding this back um i've been hinting at it i've been alluding to it but i have not been able to be transparent in the fact that i believe this is the best model for this community i've been always loyal to gym owners and i believe that this is the best opportunity vehicle for you to package your skills serve your community serve your family and in terms of roi on your time and your capital and the skills that you need to train your team on this model i believe is more
(18:29) scalable more profitable will have higher roi over the next six to 12 months um than the in-person model the the fallout questions that happen as a result of that is well what do i do with my my in-person business so there's something called a sunk cost fallacy in economics which basically means because i've invested xyz before this moment i'm going to use that to cloud the current decision at hand right and so it's like if i've spent uh i'm trying to um hopefully everyone knows what sunk cost is but it's basically you have a cup you
(19:02) have you've made an investment that is irrelevant in the in the variables of the current decision in front of you right and you're using that like i committed to you know like i spent money on xyz and all right hopefully you get the point that being said if you still need to make decisions about it you have a couple of different versions that you can handle this with all right one is that you can simply walk away from your gym and deal with the ramifications of that i don't think that the court systems i don't think that evictions and
(19:31) creditors are going to be hitting hard on businesses that so clearly were affected by this i think that we'll have if there's ever a time that you'd be able to get out of a lease this would be it this would be the time where you would be able to get out virtually scot-free and many of you already have the second solution is that you make enough money in the online setting that you can pay for it because if you think about it you have the same five thousand dollars that you're going to spend you have you're gonna have to spend it on
(19:59) whatever business you're doing right if you spent it on the superior opportunity vehicle you will make more net money doing that and then you can still like you will make more money doing that even though you have this gym as your anchor if you spent five thousand trying to fill the gym up because you have it versus spending five thousand dollars on something else you will make more money and still be able to cover the cost better because the opportunity vehicle is superior think about it let it sink in right and
(20:26) so anyways um my entire my entire goal is always to make people the most money possible is to get is to give them the freedom they want give them the security they desire and i believe that this is the best way for us as a company to do that and so all of my focus will be to that end i do think that we are actually on the precipice and we're currently in a golden opportunity era where there's this huge amount of demand for online services and there's not a lot of supply i don't know how long that window is going to happen
(20:54) but for the people that take action now most of you already have but if you were on the fence this is the time to take that action what you don't know is that many of our seven-figure gym owners the top guys you see in this group have pivoted 100 online some of the guys who hear me talk about their names all the time they've already sold their gyms and they've pivoted 100 percent to just going on because they sell all the math they didn't let their emotions cloud the judgment now i understand that everyone listening to this is human makes
(21:19) emotions emotional decisions and then puts logic to them later so let me just speak to your emotions if you have the desire for more security if you have the desire for less unknowns in the future if you have the desire to not have to worry about acquisition not worry about where your next customer is coming from worry of whether or not your lead cost is getting too i worry about whether you're going to have to have just another creative another home run to save the month right if you if you don't want to have those
(21:44) concerns right you want to be able to travel with your family you want to be able to leave your gym for god's sake you know i didn't take a vacation for five years i never even left because i was so afraid i went back for for christmas and every single year for three straight years came back after two days because i couldn't handle the stress of being gone right and so if you don't want to deal with that i do believe that there is a time winder that we're in right now where the entire marketplace understands
(22:07) now what online training is and there is a massive massive shortage of professionals who have the skill set like gym owners right like us we are all very experienced fitness professionals if you compare us to some guy who's interested in fitness on instagram right or compare us to uh even even just some of your trainers right we're more experienced than they are and so if you want to do the market a favor let people work with the best professionals and that's you because they're going to do it anyways and they
(22:37) might as well work with you so anyways um to wrap this up uh that is what all of my direction is going to be on is going to be on executing the model because this model now is as clean as a whistle in my opinion you don't like this thing is as just about as robust as the original gym loss model the front end offer is compelling we will always be able to get people to sign up for free things for weight loss period that is something i can bet on second do i believe that people can sell free trials at scale with low skill yes
(23:09) do i believe that you can sell supplements to people who want to uh lose weight in a in a in a one step in upsell environment yes do i believe that uh getting people to stay on continuity at 49 a week thirty nine dollars a week fifty nine dollars a week is something they will do for one-on-one training and support yes do i now believe that people prefer or value or get a superior experience from a one-on-one customized uh meal plan customized workouts in groups online yes i do and because of those beliefs that i have and you may
(23:42) not share those beliefs but i've made some pretty big bets in the past in this space and most of them have been right and so i'm asking you to at least factor that in if it's something that you're still on the fence about that you at least consider the the argument that i'm giving you right now um because genuinely my interest is in making you money and so our interests are aligned it's just a question of whether you believe the vehicle that i'm talking about right now is the best way most of you already made this call
(24:08) but that is what we're going to be doing with jim launch and it's been it's been very transparent that the people who run that simple model can scale and can make a lot of money because the only thing you really have to do is just make sure that you're fulfilling the clients using the app that automates 80 of it anyways and that is so much easier than having to worry about trainers sleeping with clients and broken equipment and cleaning out the bathrooms and getting the right music like all of that stuff is gone now or it has the opportunity to
(24:38) be gone if you make the choice um obviously the choice is yours we will support you at gym launch independent of what you choose if you want to rock in person we will help you all right we've done it and i honestly think you're like having seen and talked to most of the people in this industry with half of them being ex-clients of mine slash ex-employees of mine right with half of them being that i can tell you without any drop of of doubt in my mind that we are by far the best not even clubs like there's not
(25:06) like oh yeah we're like we are ages we are eons above and the proof of that if they were as good at business as we are then they would be bigger than us but they are not and so i would say trust the people who've been doing this the longest and doing this the best with the biggest uh biggest reach and biggest data set all right if you want to stay in person we will try and set you up for the best success but given your skill set and your desires and your and your wants and needs i think that that same skill set desires and beliefs would be
(25:35) better packaged in this vehicle the question is just whether or not you want to take the jump all right so anyways uh for those who have made the jump i think you made the right uh the right the right call hopefully this entire video is just reinforcing that belief for those who have made that jump uh for those of you not hopefully this um at least give you some transparency you know why we're gonna be talking more about online why it's going to be my focus and all the clients that we're going to be bringing in are all going to be gyms
(26:00) who want to go online and or you know experienced fitness professionals who want to go online and scale um because now for the first time ever that's possible right you couldn't do this without an authority you couldn't do this without a following before this but now you can so um that is that is my perspective um i hope that provides value to you i hope that provides clarity in the direction of our company and where i believe that the fitness industry is going and where we're going to be aligning our company and we do that because
(26:28) we want to align on the winning side and i think that that is going to be the winning side um no one 50 years from now would say if you're thinking about it known 20 years from now i'd be like man who would have thought that in-person gyms were going to survive this long right that online fitness was not going to be bigger 10 years from now than it is now right i don't think anyone's going to make that argument and so i think that it's um it was time for me to make that that make that line in the sand for us as a
(26:53) business of what we are going to focus on um and that is what we are going to focus on so anyways lots of love um as always we're still going to release plays we're going to release you know the stuff that we do to uh to help jim's because that is what we've always done but i just want to be honest about what i see so that you can be on the same page [Music] you

I Built My $100M Business WRONG... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKCrYIWPHLc

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone happy uh hump day wednesday uh i want to make this quick video for you uh because i'm gonna be sharing some of the lessons that i did from that i got from a uh uh 500 million dollar mastermind but it was basically eight people eight entrepreneurs who together were doing uh over 500 million dollars a year i was the second smallest so we'll we'll finish this year i think at 32 million um i think there was one guy at like seven um and then but everybody and then another one was at around my 35
(00:31) and then the rest of them were almost all above 100 and we had one guy over 250. and the biggest i'll tell you the two biggest takeaways that i have from that entire experience the big the first one was when i looked at the biggest of them they sold simple right uh simple scales and so the term that i've given myself to like remember this is scale zero which is i have to get my business to a point where there's literally zero requirement of me zero not like eat like zero none as in like it just keeps going and growing
(01:11) and by getting to that point where it requires zero then i can scale it without becoming the bottleneck and so let me see if i can unpack this in a useful way for everyone like right now if you're doing anything within the business if you were to double the business the question is are you going to have to double the amount of stuff that you do many times it's a yes and to be honest with you it takes a long time to get like you're going to move up the skill set like in the beginning you do everything and then you're going to
(01:40) outsource some administrative work and then you're going to outsource some you know back-end customer service work and then you're going to outsource the sales and then and then you'll start outsourcing maybe the marketing and then after that you'll you know maybe outsource the messaging behind your overarching position in the marketplace but at some point literally the only thing that should be left for you to do is just make decisions and not all decisions but just the biggest and most important decisions right
(02:05) and so if that is what is left for you to do then there's basically zero right and so scaling zero means that for me to get bigger i must get smaller within the company i must become less and less and less important to the company's success in order for the company to grow without me being the bottleneck of it and i think that um this has just been such so incredibly telling uh for me going through this and watching each of them uh what the people who are doing more than me how how little they were doing and that's by
(02:40) design that's deliberate it's hard to do that and you fail a lot and you hire people and they mess up and you eat those costs of mistakes but that's why you know finding really good people is important but scaling zero has been my the the brand like the branding that i'm trying to send into my brain it's like scale zero like get yourself down to zero because only then i'll be able to scale otherwise if i'm doing 20 hours a week of work and we double that i'll be at 40 right and so that has been probably one of the biggest lessons the
(03:11) next lesson that i learned was that from just about everybody else there and mind you the lessons that i'm sharing with you now are the lessons that i'm learning in my current chapter my current season you may not be in this season but i want to be transparent with you that this is what i'm learning right now and the lesson that i learned was that everybody else was going after a bigger marketplace than i was and so they were all wildly impressed that we've been able to you know generate a hundred million dollars in a
(03:37) single niche but they're like man you know you're really good at this stuff you should be going after multiple you just go after a bigger market like you're in a pond they're like or a lake you should be going after the ocean and so that was what i saw was consistent between all of them was that they were all in oceans and i was in a lake and so that was probably the biggest the second biggest takeaway um that i had the third biggest takeaway here's a bonus one for you is that everything that everyone sold there was simple um and i'm gonna
(04:12) say simple in two different ways one is that of everyone there i was the only one who had three businesses terrible idea um i mean we've i've i've learned my lessons and we've been able to build it but i had to take steps backwards and really work myself to death in order to get all three of them you know over eight and multi-figures in order to to to work right but i feel like i lost probably two years of development for myself as an entrepreneur because i split my attention and every single other person there
(04:42) had one business that they were focused on and more specifically one customer and so um that was a big lesson for me now you can have multiple businesses but for just about everybody who's listening to this you're probably not that at that level like and i'm and i'm not saying that you know douchely but like if you're buying a business that's very different than you starting multiple of them and being ceo of them all if you have multiple businesses and this is a mistake that i made early on and a mistake that i've made
(05:12) again later on if you're ceo of all of them you do like you it's for just about every human besides elon musk it's not feasible and so every other person that i know makes who's made a tremendous amount of money made it in one vehicle and then they may own pieces of other businesses right and if they are the main owner in in multiple businesses which is rare but if they are the main owner in those businesses they are not a partner they're not an active partner in that business they've hired a ceo they've hired an executive team
(05:43) that can run and grow that business without them um but i remember hearing that when i was younger it was like oh man this guy has all these companies he doesn't own all the companies that he's like he's not in it right he's not in any of them he's got teams of executives and high level producers who are incentivized usually with some level of equity in that company and he advises strategically um and so that was you know again one of the reminders we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught myself included um that one of the
(06:11) mistakes that i was making that everyone else there was not and so i'll recap it for you because i'm doing it for myself too the first was scaling zero i have to get down to zero in order to scale otherwise i'll be the bottleneck the second was going after oceans instead of lakes um again remember this is me at my season if you're if you're starting out going after a lake is not a bad idea which is why me making the decision to just niche down to a single you know niche of gyms was not a bad decision because it was the right call
(06:36) at that time now we've developed a skill set that we you know now we've helped agencies in 100 plus niches generate clients for their clients and so i feel very adept at that skill third is focusing on one main business as your primary vehicle and an interesting thing that i found out recently was the word the the root of the word etymology behind the word decide decision um so c day like suicide patricide matricide side is to kill homicide right it's kill and so a decision is where you choose to kill off all the
(07:08) all other things so you you select by elimination right which i kind of like that so it's like when you decide you're actively choosing to kill off other things and so you need to decide what your business is going to be and kill off all other options and so that is the the third lesson um that i got from all of those those people here that were at that mastermind and the and the fourth one um was every single one of them was selling a tremendously high margin gross gross margin um service and or product except for one of them uh and the two
(07:44) people who were selling the lowest margin stuff were the smaller businesses and so when i heard that it was really it was challenging for me in a good way of thinking like how can we provide value in bigger ways for less hard costs to us as business owners and risk and so as i think about you know the next moves that i'll do in my entrepreneurial career i'm taking those things into consideration so it's what am i going to do that is going to go after an ocean instead of a lake what am i going to do that's going to be just one thing so not
(08:15) lots of things attacking the ocean just one what thing is going to be you know very high margin but very high value which is difficult a lot of times you can you can do high margin but low hopefully you get what i'm saying here i want a high a high margin thing that is high value um and sometimes that's hard to find and then finally i want to structure it in such a way that i can get it to the point where i am not the bottleneck of the business because i have um better better decision making leaders so not just not just like in the beginning you have
(08:48) doers and then you have managers and then you have leaders and then you have decision makers and leaders to a certain degree are getting into that it depends on what level of leadership but really finding high level people who have the experience of doing this thing in the past they've already run and won the olympic gold i don't want to teach someone how to do it i want someone who's already done it and can just plug right in and comes pre-loaded with the solutions they come batteries included um as uh as maxwell
(09:13) says and so um anyways those are the biggest findings um that i had now looking back three months later after the dust has settled from that half a billion dollar mastermind and those are the lessons that i took away from it so i hope that was valuable for you if you want the the inner the inner secrets of what what's happening behind the scenes in those in those types of rooms um those are the types of conversations that we're having and i hope you found that valuable and i'll see in the next vid

(00:00) yeah so we lost like we lost like a couple deals the past couple weeks to companies that are charging like 200 a month you know retainer and we're like we're [ __ ] better than these we're so much better than these companies we give more we're like we coach better oh everybody can make them more money and they're like [ __ ] go with this company or because they're 200 a month so i would so so tj so if you were if you were on the phone and you're like hey alex there's this guy down the street for two hundred dollars a month i'd be like hey
(00:32) man i was like what do you sell personal training for 200 a month right training for right i mean you would the guy would tell him he'd be like i don't know 80 bucks an hour like cool i got a kid down the street he'll do it for 10 bucks whose training do you think is better why do you think he's got to charge 10 right get what you pay for and so that being said if you want to go there the thing is is if you spend 200 to get nothing is that a better investment than spending a thousand in getting 10x on it so is it really a
(01:06) cost if we're looking at how much money we're going to make when you invest in a stock are you like well amazon's more expensive than than bank of america it's price to value it's like price is what you pay value is what you get right if you're getting [ __ ] for 200 it's still a bad investment that's how you break right well pricing comparison yeah one of my favorites is like well [ __ ] man why didn't you go with them yeah like they're only like [ __ ] man but like yeah the one case scenario is like we did the call
(01:39) with the guy first and then the next day he's like i got another company i'm talking with blah blah blah he's not with them we followed up with him he's like yeah i went with them because they were like two dollars a month we were like that's fine and it happens the thing is is he'll be back right yeah but the other side of it is uh because here's candidly they have no way to acquire customers you know they're ltv dude if he keeps him for a [ __ ] year it's 2400 right he's not competition that's kind of my point here but yeah even if it were and
(02:09) this did come up right one of my favorite clothes is called the comparison close all right which i say all right let's pretend price isn't an option all right let's say we're both priced at the exact same amount which one would you rather do they're gonna say you right i'd be like why and then they're gonna be like well you know i like the fact that you guys got the coaching thing uh i mean i like selling higher ticket that's that kind of makes more sense to me they'll start telling you why and you're like right you like anything else
(02:35) you keep going anything else any other reasons anything else like about roi what about risk what about like track record any of those things matter well yeah i guess that too like right and for that reason you can understand why we're not 200 as you let them sell you on the reason of why they would rather do you they spend three minutes telling you about why you're better you're like right you can understand why we're not 200 yeah but i like the stock example because it's listen it's like the price of the stock is irrelevant it's what you get
(03:01) for what you pay if you pay 200 you flush it down the toilet is that a good deal of course not if you pay a thousand dollars and you get 10 back is that a good deal of course so the price has nothing to do with our discussion but everything to do with how likely you are to hit your goal that's good how likely do you think you are to hit your goal and how important is your time do you want to waste three more months not hitting your goal trying another mickey mouse thing do you think if he was really the best in the industry like let's be real for a
(03:31) second do you think if he was the best in the industry the most likely to help you hit your goal he would charge you the same amount as a [ __ ] boot camp client yes or no [ __ ] hell no of course not so then why do you think it would be reasonable that he'd be better of course he's not so the question is are you being cheap are you gonna get burned twice today right or do you want to buy nice you can buy nice or buy twice right it's up to you

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone my name's alex from ozzie and i am the host of the show owner of allen prestige labs gym launch 120 million in sales um in 44 45 months what i want to talk about today is something that i think is really important i get a lot of questions about and it's about long-term short-term investing some big pitfalls and i just want to share with you some of the mistakes that i've made in this kind of transition that i've been through going from kind of ceo to kind of investor slash capital allocator right
(00:30) so the first thing is i want to share some some some stats with you that i found really interesting i think it was fidelity uh did a study it was either fidelity or charles schwab did a study on which investor profiles and activity yielded the best returns in terms of total portfolio value right and this was in stocks and they found that there were two categories far outpaced everyone else let me tell you what they were the first and highest performing portfolio activity were people who had purchased stocks and then died
(01:08) and so as a result there was no more activity in their account and their accounts outperformed everyone else the second highest were people who purchased accounts or purchased stocks for the account and then had forgotten their password as a result had not done any trading and so for me i think this is hilarious because it shows credible flaws in human judgment and it also shows the power of compounding growth when buying businesses in general because then you just get exposure because if you think about this from across all of the
(01:39) accounts that they have then across all of the accounts then they have equal exposure to ups and downs etc so across all of those accounts which is just like taking an index of the market the people who do the least amount have the most money in the account now what i want to do is explain to you a mistake that i made probably like two weeks ago that cost me shoot i have to do the math it probably cost me 200 grit yeah it tossed me 200 grand all right so here's a 200 000 mistake that you don't have to make and i'm going to
(02:09) walk you through the math all right so what i was doing um is i have in my quote portfolio i guess it's not a quote portfolio it's my portfolio um i have three to five percent of it uh in investable assets that i candidly i just play around with and it scratches my entrepreneurial itch and just me being a human being 95 it's actually 97 of my uh worth is in really really stable stuff all right but i want to talk to you about the five percent so here's the difference between holding versus trading all right and
(02:44) this is something that is massively underlooked and i'm hoping to at least convince one person who's listening to this that if you look at the math you you see how quickly you shouldn't do you shouldn't try and you shouldn't try and beat the market um by pi by by trading all right and so here's here's the first reality is that there's huge quantitative firms that have hundreds of analysts who are trying to beat you and they they make their money doing that um but the second one is a simple hundred dollar example all
(03:14) right so let's say you have a hundred dollars all right so this is our this is our initial capital all right i'm going to give you two scenarios that we're going to walk through so in scenario number one we're going to have our day trading example and let's say that over x period of time you do really well now i'm just going to ignore the fact that most people just going to lose money all right so that's that's probably like 75 of all of us are going to mess up somehow and think we're going to beat it and end up you know i'm going
(03:44) to quote by the dip and then it just goes down by another 50 right but let's just assume you double your money all right so your 100 becomes 200 all right everyone's cool so let's just say that happens over a five-year timeline whatever all right now the point here is that uh it doesn't really matter because if you're in this as soon as you are doing this through trading then the capital gains treatment gets thrown out the window and it becomes regular income all right so you're taxed differently so this hundred dollar gain
(04:16) right that you have here from 100 to 200 gets taxed at uh 45 you know 43 whatever it is and so you have a uh an additional let's see here so that means that after this whole period of time you're gonna you're gonna be left with a hundred and uh 40 sorry 155 dollars all right sorry about that 155 dollars which are left after tax all right post tax now don't worry i'm going to show you a third scenario in a second the second scenario is you do it and you instead of trading that whole time you just earn the same amount
(04:58) 200 100 turns to 200 and candidly the my all my passive stuff is out has outperformed my active stuff which is hilarious but uh which just confirms this for me which is why i'm making this video all right so let's just say that you still you make the same hundred dollars all right we're good there hundred dollars but now it's capital gains all right so instead of being left with 155 dollars we're now left with 180 wow well that's bigger but let me show you and this is the thing that kind of blew my mind because that's why i love looking at the
(05:30) math so much is well then how much would i have to gain from day trading or trading on shorter terms or swing trades or whatever um for this to be worth it right how how much extra money would i have to make to outpace the fact that i'm i'm getting this regular income tax treatment on my income all right so here's what's crazy so in order for me to get to net eighty dollars right i would have to take that hundred dollar investment and turn it into i did the math earlier it's um uh 245 dollars all right so that means
(06:12) that i would have to my my growth here would have to be 50 you know 45 higher right isn't that crazy in order to yield because that times the regular tax treatment gets me 180 dollars all right so if i'm comparing the two things if i want to be left with 180 option one is i buy something and i forget about it and then later if i you know five years later i'm i sell it for whatever reason and i am left with 180 because i only had to pay capital gains on it in scenario in order for me to to just match that not even beat it i would have
(06:51) to take my hundred dollars and turn it into 245 and then sell it and this is obviously this whole time you're continuing to flip things and buy things and buy things right and then after the regular income tax i'd be left with 180 all right and so when i saw that illustration it became so obvious to me because i had had some decent gains in something um and so i decided to sell it and i actually ended up selling it at a good time uh because it ended up going down cause i felt like i was getting overvalued um and so i thought i felt
(07:25) pretty good about myself right and what ended up happening is uh the thing ended up coming back up to exactly where i had sold it uh again and so if i had literally just done nothing then i would have more money because now i have to pay uh i have to pay taxes on regular income because i sold it within a year and mind you again guys this is on my three to five percent i don't touch anything that's that's not that all right so i'm just being very clear and candid here nor do i recommend you do that so if you need the look if you need
(08:00) the itch then i would say put your put three percent aside um for pure speculation which is just like i'm which is basically just saying i'm a human being and i'm an idiot and this is how i can manage my idiocy um but but when you see the math spelled out like this between this is what smart people do and this is what dumb people who don't make as much money do then it makes me so much more inclined to just do what smart people do and take all of that extra time and just do something else or just make money with my extra
(08:29) time um one of my good friends he uh i've known him for 20 25 years and when i met him he was i think he was he was managing i mean maybe five million dollars like not which in the finance world was not a lot for management um and now 25 years later i think he manages 3.5 billion he's one of the most stable people that i know and when i talk to him about this stuff he's like you need a hobby and so i guess the message that i have for everyone is maybe get a hobby and just let the money grow and pretend you're a dead person
(09:06) and if you can't pretend you're a dead person then throw away your password uh or give it to somebody that you would be ashamed to ask for your password back uh so that you just don't touch your stuff uh because ultimately you'll probably be you'll probably end up getting higher gains a and b you'll get tax less on those gains so i hope that was valuable for you i hope this makes sense i hope you get a laugh out of my 200 000 mistake that i just made in the last two weeks um keep being awesome lots of love like
(09:35) subscribe and leave a comment and i'll try and get back to everybody who does so keeping awesome catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) i'll make this a short one for you i just got off a call uh with a company that i have a vested interest in um and so uh we were talking about how to set up the management metrics in place for the business as we're trying to scale it and so one of uh one of the things i picked up from andy grove in uh shoot what is called high output management i think um is paired metrics and um it was it was just a great epiphany for me and so i'm going to share it with you so the way that any growth who's the founder of intel very smart dude
(00:33) manages each of the roles within the company is that he tries to put paired metrics in place so it's not just number of sales or just closing percentage or just insert one thing here right most times and this is just myself included i would usually should be like this is the one key metric that i want to look at right this is the one thing that matters for this position but if you think a little bit more about it it tends to be two that are in parallel all right and so what it does is help you helps you manage the balance or the
(01:02) dichotomy between uh the performance and roll and typically it'll be between speed or output in terms of total volume and quality all right and so the way that you balance this within any position would be for example if you're talking to a salesperson it would be total number of sales against refunds back outs all right if you're looking at a customer service position it might be uh speed of ticket resolution or total number of tickets handled and uh customer satisfaction or uh nps or like a promoter score right uh so that
(01:36) would be a balance between two different metrics that you're that you're looking at and then that way because at the end of the day you you never really want to because a lot of times in business it's not about either extreme it's about managing a dichotomy of being uh am i being micromanaging or am i delegating too much right like is either of them wrong no you want to follow kind of right in that middle path and in different times you might lean towards one area or the other area more but when you're looking at each
(02:02) component of the business you can look at balance metrics and so um i'll break down more examples because i think it might be useful for you so if you're looking at a marketing position it's going to be total number of applications against qualified applications right so it's like okay this is the total volume i got but how many were qualified right um the next would be the sales guy which i just went over like total sales volume or closing percentage against backouts all right the service position uh total number of uh responses and or tickets uh
(02:33) handled or customer complaints resolved or speed of resolution against uh the quality score right um on the back end let's see i'm trying to think of other positions that you can have for this uh i mean like right now obviously i'm blanking because i'm live um but if you think about every piece of your business right now all of the people that report to you there's typically a metric that you're trying to push but something you're trying to also conversely not have happen and so if you can define both of those
(03:05) things for the person then you can push as hard as you can um on the top the top side right the speed or the volume metric and balance it so another example is if you're in a physical products business it would be inventory against shortages right you don't want to have tons and tons of inventory because that's not good you have lots of cash that's sitting there it's not good for the business it's dangerous for the business but if you just say hey i want you to just keep our inventories as low as possible right then you're going to
(03:31) start having shortages right and so you want to balance inventory against shortages and then that's the metric that you're reporting on for that position right so for me that would be my finance department who's managing that component of our business in the supplement side right um uh taxes versus audits right or i you know any kind of issue that you have the irs and so with each of these things that have you have the positive thing what you're going for against the negative thing you're trying to avoid and so um i
(03:59) want to call this the sweet spot which clearly i didn't and i'll name it later um but that's the managing the dichotomy in management using parallel metrics um will get you so much closer to the sweet spot of optimum performance for each of these roles and also going through the mental exercise for yourself will help you to find those things for each of the roles in your business and ultimately the only thing that's going to allow you to scale the business uh if you're in the service space which many of the people are listening are is initially
(04:27) it's going to be your ability to to to train people and onboard people right so it's in your culture and you're training your training gets them up up and going culture keeps them going right um and then the keeping them going is making sure that you're monitoring the right things for them so you can get the outcome that you really want right and so um i just had this uh call with the founder of that business that i'm now invested in um and we were talking about how we're setting that business up to scale so that each of the roles that we
(04:53) have um get balanced out and so for there we have uh image editors so we can see the total number of images they're edited it's a photography based business um against the number of callbacks or corrections that need to happen and so you can see this in virtually every position that exists within your business but if you simply look at that name them and explain it to the person then they'll understand everything that you want and then you'll ultimately make more money and then they will feel like they have more clarity and if they don't
(05:20) understand how to do those things then you train right and that's the entire that's the whole game is you train them you give them the two metrics you walk the middle and then that is how you maintain uh high level performance over an organization so um shout out to andy grove for being smarter than me hopefully that was useful for you for me that was a huge takeaway uh when i was going through his book um and so use it make more money have higher profits have a happier team have a happy wednesday lots of love catch you soon

Why I Turned down two people who offered me $50K (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpPoIOPgoAw

Transcript:
(00:00) i wanted to make a another little video for you because it was on my mind and i thought it was uh i was telling someone else about the story and i figured i might as well share with you guys so um so some of you guys might know uh we were just at the funnel hacking live event where some of the speakers were talking about high ticket sales and um you know we won in one of the rewards which is like it's called the axe award which is um it means you did over 10 million in sales which is pretty cool um i mean we were
(00:28) excited about it but i mean it's awesome but the the thing that happened afterwards is where i kind of want to bring the lesson home so i had a couple people after we you know spoke and um we were kind of showcased as kind of a success story type thing um who were like hey you know could you consult for my business i'd like to do something like this in my space and chiropractors and dentists or blah blah blah right and people um offer to pay us 50 000 for a single day we have two people come up and offer that for us to
(00:59) kind of coach them on their business help them scale help them start doing high ticket whatever right and my wife uh before i even had a chance to answer the question um step forward and said no we don't do that and um i wanted to kind of highlight why it was important and why um why that kind of attitude has helped us grow so fast and so what happens is you you know continue to scale and continue to make more money continue to have stuff that works is that the better you are the better the opportunities that you
(01:30) have to say no to are and so what happens especially as entrepreneurs a lot of times we see things that we're like man this would be so cool i got like six businesses and like none of them really make money but like i'm like i don't know which one i'm gonna do but i'm gonna invest in all of them and like i'm gonna see which one takes off but like that's fundamentally flawed because you as an entrepreneur make any business take off and any single business can be as big as you want it to be and so all you're doing when you're diluting your
(01:53) attention is you're diluting your attention and then ultimately you're ensuring that none of them will work right and so we turn down these two 50 000 a day consulting clients because the attention that that would take is going to take more from our business than it will give us um and making decisions in that way has been probably the number one thing that has grown us to where we are now i can't tell you the amount of guys who i think are um than we are and it's because they can't focus like they cannot focus they can't stick to
(02:23) one thing they do launch after launch they switch product they switch industries they switch customer avatars they're like i was thinking about doing this and i was doing this and um they just can't stick with it right and if you look at our business right and if you look at our gym model and then if you look at our current gym launch business it's all about doing the same thing over and over and over again and it's so boring it's so boring right all you do is you get really good at doing one thing and then that's it and as much as
(02:48) you want to do the next thing all you do is you go back to that first thing and you do it better and you do it better and you do it better right and that's all you do is you continue to scale if you look at the difference between a 30 million dollar your business and 100 million your business so right now we're on pace for a 30 million uh run rate is where we're at now um if you look at that versus 100 million business they're virtually the same the only thing that changes is that a 100 million business does more of
(03:11) the same thing they just do more instead of having 10 set five sales a day they do 15 sales a day that's it it's the only difference they're not doing new verticals they're not constantly um trying to sell different things they usually cut focus on the same customer avatar and they solve the same problem that they're really good at solving they sell it better and that's it and so by us turning down these 250 000 a day consulting deals um i can guarantee you that having that fitness is what has been some of the reasons for
(03:40) our success is that we've been able to focus on doing one for you to not look at if you're a gym owner not look at online training not look at meal prep services not look at um all the many things that you can do that will distract you um you know doing this jv or doing this this 50 50 thing with my buddy who's got this little thing going on the side like there are always things but i can guarantee you that they always have strings attached and the strings are attached to your attention and that's the most valuable asset you
(04:09) have now your time it's your attention and so even if we did do this 50 000 consulting day even if we did do this fifty thousand dollar consulting day um what would end up happening is that person after that dance would still try and take attention and ultimately what that'll do not allow us to fulfill on the promise that we made to our initial gym owners who came to us and so if i take that same amount of attention and then i put it towards the existing model we have and brick vibrate continue to stack don't make more and more and more
(04:40) focusing on those fundamentals than you want anything else so um sometimes you got to do more to do less and i had a mentor once sometimes you got to go slow to go fast and i really believe in that and he was the ceo of a 10 billion dollar company with a b 10 billion and um i had an extended period of time where i was working really really closely with him and i learned a lot of things from him and um that was one of them was that sometimes you have to go slow to go fast and sometimes you just gotta get good at one
(05:06) thing and all you have to do is focus on doing that thing more and more despite being an entrepreneur and wanting to do lots of things the ones who make the most money are the ones who do the least right and by at least i'm not saying you don't work i'm saying you do the least amount of things and you just do a few things extremely well so double down on that don't get distracted with shiny objects the better you are the better the opportunities you have to say no to so keep that in the back of your mind say no to the meal
(05:29) prep service say no to the the online training thing say hello to the training from afar say no to the the you know the little corporate deal that you might be able to set up um because they will distract you from the main thing because those are not the end goal and if you have the gym selling them giving amazing results get them send more people to you and do that over and over and over and over again and then one day you will look up and you'll be really really that's the point all right it's awesome a lot of us are
(05:53) just used to struggle and we basically self sabotage um by just putting us more stuff on a stuff on our plate rather than just focusing some of you guys right now have multiple things on your plate and you can't focus on it um but imagine if you only had one thing to focus on maybe it was one location you have three and you know you should have done it you should have only had one how easy would it be to make money with one location super easy because you have all your attention on it right but some of you are making attention with
(06:17) three right maybe not making money with three same thing if you're multiple businesses you can't make it right a lot of times because your attention's still split so focus in on one thing that makes you money and do that over and over and over and over again until you're sick of it and then do more of it and i promise you'll make money all right lots of love guys hope you have an amazing day i'll catch you guys [Music] you

“The 3 Evil Es” That Almost Killed My Business - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone it's alex mosey uh ceo of alid prestige labs gym launch we've done 120 million dollars in sales the last four years and so today what i want to talk about is the three entrepreneurial evil ease of entrepreneurship all right so these are the three kind of ease that i that i see over and over again from the entrepreneurs that we work with directly in our portfolio companies but also in the entrepreneurs that i talk to in general the biggest mistakes that are made stem from these three evil ease and so what
(00:29) i'm going to do is i'm gonna i'm gonna walk through all three of them i'll tell you an easy way to try and at least attenuate the mistakes that you can make from them and then at the end i'll show you the one that i think is actually the the most evil of them all all right so the first e is expectations all right and the reason that this one is so evil is that most of the time us entrepreneurs we think that everything has to happen immediately right i had an entrepreneur not that long ago reach out to me and say hey how
(00:57) can you know if we work together how can you guarantee that i'm going to get to a million dollars a month within the next six months and they were currently i think doing a hundred thousand dollars a month um and that kind of expectation and mindset is literally what will destroy you in business because what happens is you set these arbitrary because all the goals are arbitrary for the most part right these numbers that in your mind make you feel good or make you feel accomplished and you set these things up there
(01:27) with not a huge path of getting there and you put an arbitrary timeline on it and then you try and force yourself into it and so it ends up happening is you take shortcuts you make hasty high risk decisions and most of the time you end up destroying the business and taking 10 steps backwards and so expectations that we set for ourselves and our teams we want to be intolerant of anything other than excellence but focused far more on the process than the outcome so if you could shift the expectations from outcome-based expectations to
(02:00) process-based expectations and then meet that with the intolerance of excellence right or tolerating only x links excuse me then you can help mitigate expectation evils right where you basically destroy your business as a result of thinking that you have to be a million dollars a month or a hundred thousand dollars a month or ten thousand a month or whatever that number is for you by x time right what i see again and again and again of the people who make way more money than i do is they have reasonable expectations
(02:29) that would be unreasonable to achieve based on process right i have a mentor right now who who always repeats the same thing he says good process drives good results and i just that's that's been something i've been trying to ingrain in my mind good process drives good results all right so that's evil number one the second evil is emotions all right the second thing that will kill your business all right if you look at the biggest ceos in the world you look at the bezos as you look at you know you look at you look at monger you look at buffett
(03:00) you look at all these guys right and what you may notice is that they are very devoid of emotion and it's not that they're like emotionless people it's more so that they try and stay as even-handed as possible with the decisions and this is just something that i've observed and so here's a telltale sign that you can tell for yourself if you're if you're suffering from this because sometimes it's hard especially for guys for us to be like i'm emotional right now right but like we're human we have emotions and so
(03:26) if you're if you're looking and you flip flop a lot on decisions as in you're presented the same data and one day you feel this way and another way you feel another day you feel this way and literally how you process the decision flip-flops all the time it's because you're being subject to emotions now if you look at the trajectory of a business and the and the the hundreds and thousands of decisions that we have to make as an entrepreneur you could see how quickly these thousands of decisions can spin this way or this way on this
(03:50) path based on your emotions and it can be the right way or the wrong way and so i'll give you here's here's two two pieces to this it's it's very difficult to eliminate emotions right but if you can detect when you are emotional then you can decrease the speed of your decision-making which is usually contrary to what most people do when they are emotional they speed up their decision-making process when they're in emotions all right and so if you feel urgency so for me these are these are things that are like red flags if i feel
(04:20) like i have to make a decision by today or whatever most times it's completely fictitious and made up in my mind and so what i try and do is extend the time horizon between uh the the feeling i have and when i actually decide to take action i can't tell you the amount of huge mistakes that i was able to avoid simply by sleeping it off right giving my myself 24 hours to think on it right and a lot of times the entire world looks different when you wake up in the morning and so that should frighten you because it frightens me how can the
(04:50) world look so different only you know after nine hours of sleep right it's because our emotional state's different and so this is a a tactic that i do like a lot um for managing emotions so the best decisions that we make for ourselves in my opinion or that i have made for myself have come from a state of contentment and so there have probably been a moment that's why when you go on vacation you feel like you have a lot of clarity it's because you're in the correct emotional state to make the right decisions because you're not operating from a
(05:21) place of scarcity right you're not operating from a place of have to you're not operating from a place of deficiency where i am not good enough right when you're operating from a place of contentment um and i'm not saying we're always content that's not my point right the point is that you could probably recognize those times where you sit back and you're feeling great you know you have a lot of gratitude for an experience or or things that give you perspective and so it's in those time periods where you should make big decisions for your life
(05:51) and then know that you made them in the proper emotional state this is something that i'm actively focused a lot on for me because the being in the correct making the right call is basically my only job now it's really just proper decision making and so when i sense myself in a well-rested content you know full of gratitude mood that is when i want to look at my most complex issues my most complex multi-variable you know decisions and say this is what i think the best course of action is and then sticking with that even when the
(06:25) the the trials and tribulations that are inevitably going to happen as a result of the decision later down the road and so that's my that's my hack is i can't get around emotion i try and extend time horizons whenever i feel urgency and then if um if i'm going to make emotions from an emotional state i try and go from a place of contentment and gratitude and if i do not feel that state i don't usually make the decision so think about that so if you have like moments when you're playing with your kids and you look back you're like man
(06:54) life's awesome that's when you make the decisions that you need to make about your life all right because from there you'll be operating with a much longer time horizon and that's i think my way i think this this is doing it that way will trick yourself into extending your time horizon which ultimately will lead to better decision making and the third e um of the third evils evil oops i'm writing down evil um is or are excuse me are expenses all right so the first two one is what you think should happen the emotions affect how you think it
(07:26) should happen and the expenses are the the the it's like the cloud and the dirt right are the things that that we incur along the way that increase the risk of it not occurring right so if you think about expenses in general they are liabilities they are risk that we take on and so if if our goal is as entrepreneurs is to increase our upside and decrease our downside right that is kind of entrepreneurship and business in general right then actively thinking about decreasing our downside our liabilities is a way of
(07:53) increasing the likelihood that our expectations are met right and so one of the biggest mistakes and biggest evils that will destroy entrepreneurial businesses is because they set massive expectations when they are emotional and emotionally deficient because they need to satisfy you know emotional needs that their parents didn't meet when they were kids they then incur expenses that they shouldn't otherwise have to meet these demands that are completely arbitrary and made up in their minds right and so i see this what happen all the time it's
(08:25) like hey we want to scale we just hired four more people so that we can scale it doesn't work that way get the growth first and then the growth will pay for the people don't put the cart in front of the horse the only exception to this is if you have like commission only uh you know reps like sales reps things like that but most other times 99 of other times when you are incurring greater expenses it's not like it's it should not be to quote anticipate growth right growth will pay the expenses and if you need to quote delay
(09:06) something for a smaller period of time so that you can shore up your infrastructure then you can do that and you would be amazed at how much flexibility there is right it's much easier to solve problems with cash in the bank with with contracts signed and you're an entrepreneur like solving problems is what we do right and so if you're in that state think about how much you eat like if you need to if you have the immediate demand right you will solve the problem and the people will come i promise you all right one of the biggest mistakes that i mean
(09:39) i've made this one so many times um i hired 25 support reps in anticipation of growth for our supplement company prestige labs two years ago and i currently now have four people that handle more business than the 25 did think about that and so what happens is when you anticipate growth you don't even know what the growth is going to look like and so you basically just put people there the culture of the team decreases the morale of the team decreases they're being less efficient and when you have lots of people you don't think about
(10:10) driving good process right you just think like we'll just throw more bodies at the problem and that's a horrible way to go about business it's also not a good customer experience in the long run and so if we can adjust our expectations to be reasonable and based on process not outcome by managing our emotions and making decisions from a place of contentment right so that we don't set these deficient expectations on ourselves and our business that we have to satisfy because we must be a certain way by this time
(10:39) then we won't incur expenses and risk that is undue and not necessarily that will that will likely destroy our business when it was a hundred percent based on our false made-up expectations about what we thought should happen should and so when i look at the things that undo entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial businesses these are the three evil e's expectations emotions and expenses and i told you at the beginning that i would share the one that i think is the most deadly and it's this guy in my opinion expectations
(11:12) because what we believe because these are basically beliefs just said differently right another way to say this and this is this is a really a really good way that i got from a different coach to reframe beliefs is she said if you just call all your beliefs assumptions they will be far more malleable and it's such a it's words matter right and if we call our beliefs assumptions they become far more changeable for ourselves and so if i say this is my assumption what do you guys think rather than this is my expectation what do you guys think
(11:46) see how different that feels but they function the same way right but one of them is approachable one of them is malleable one of them can take new feedback and new inputs and new data and the other one is a must a should a have to right and so if we can readjust our expectations right and be focused on our product over delivering delighting the customers right being intolerant of anything but excellence in the process and because of that our emotions stay more stable because we're not missing goals that we have to
(12:19) hit right which then create more scarcity more deficiency more more guttural feelings that then make us shorten our decision-making loops that cause poorer decisions and then cause us to make poor decisions that create expenses all right so this is a loop that self-reinforces and it can either be a virtuous or vicious cycle and so it starts at the top and spins all the way around and so those are the three evil ease of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial mistakes that hopefully you can use some of these tactics
(12:48) to to avoid all right don't don't hire before you need it let the growth pay for the expenses when you're making decisions try and extend the the space this is what i found effective for me and try and make decisions from a point of gratitude and contentment and then keep the expectations driven around process not outcome and if you can keep the high like keep your high expectations but keep them on process not on what has to happen because when you reverse it the other way you'll start making terrible decisions so anyways i hope that was
(13:21) valuable for you i hope that makes sense like you know subscribe all the all the dings and whistles that you know youtube folks are supposed to say so anyways lots of love keep being awesome i'll catch you guys on the flip side bye

The Mind-Blowing Reason A Competitor Made Twice As Much As Me - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) so i was i was 24 and i was running ads in my space and i was getting 15 to 20 to 1 returns in a local market and i've been doing this for like a year at this point so i was like i felt pretty good about myself and then there's this competitor who moved into my area and somehow we hopped on the phone and uh and he was just killing he was just killing it he was doing like he was selling more people than we were i was like what the is this guy doing right and he told me that he was converting how many percent of his leads
(00:31) is converting and i was converting two and a half times more leads than he was like i was he was converting 10 i was converting 25 of my leads like i was killing it but i was like what the like how is this even possible i mean i was spending 100 a day and he was spending 500 a day and he would spend 15 000 and he would make 60 and keep 45 and i would spend three and make you know whatever 25 or whatever it was and i you know i was making 22 and he was he was making twice as much money as me even though he was spending five times
(01:05) as much and that's when i was like wait none of this matters like it's just about who makes the most money and so at some point you're gonna like just everyone all your will get less effective i'm just telling like it will be less excuse me less efficient in terms of spend but that's part of scaling you

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i wanted to make this short short video for you um because i had a number of conversations last week that resulted in kind of this consistent uh point of coaching which is it's never gonna work forever and so i've seen this happen in so many different situations where people will try and give themselves a reason to not even begin something because they think that there is an end to it when the reality is the only things that don't actually have an end to them are things that you do not understand and so
(00:31) if you don't if you see something as a forever option then it probably means you do not understand it well enough to begin doing it so there's a little mind for you um and so let me give you a couple examples to bring this home so you know when i was you know in the fitness space i had a lot of people who'd come up to me and be like hey man like i want to start working out i want to get bigger i was like awesome you know this is how you got to train blah blah and they'd be like well i don't want to get too big
(00:58) i'm like you don't even look like you work out so why don't we start with that and then we can worry about you getting too big right so it's not a perfect example for business but that's an example of somebody trying to discount starting because they think they see an end that they do not even understand the journey well enough to comprehend another example would be hey we're running tick-tock ads right now and we're crushing it right and someone says well we don't know how long tick tock is going to be around or snapchat or insert
(01:28) whatever new opportunity there is and so we don't want to do it right but the reality is all opportunities are by their very nature arbitrage where you're taking advantage of inefficiencies within two systems or two markets and so over time all arbitrage disappears right and then markets become more efficient that's how markets work right more and more people see the opportunity the bit the arbitrage decreases until eventually it's efficient right and so when you're looking at opportunities and you see something and it might be a big
(02:01) opportunity only is going to be open for two years three years do you do it or not it's another series of questions that would happen after that but i would not discount it simply because you know that it is finite because all opportunities are finite and to take this exaggera you know this example to a max degree of exaggeration think about the fortune 500.
(02:21) there's only one company that's been on there for over 100 years and that's ge just one one company right and so every one of those companies you might have thought or during their day might be like this thing's gonna be here forever the reality is it's not and markets change so rapidly it's difficult to reshift an entire infrastructure some companies can do it many fail and so if your business is founded upon taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity or an inefficiency in a marketplace or something that is fleeting right that comes and goes
(02:55) that's okay many businesses were built off of arbitrage opportunities that created cash flow human resources that could then be deployed and pivoted in another direction when the opportunity closes and so it's kind of like saying well i don't want to invest in this investment because it's only going to triple my money in three years well what do i do after it triples my money well you take the money you invest it somewhere else right it's the same concept except you're just applying it to your business and so this is just a caveat that was top of
(03:28) mind that i figured i would share with you because just so many times we try and take 10 steps forward without even realizing that there's this big pile of money and you can just pick it up and move about your life and it doesn't need to be forever and so it's just a remembering like if this were an investment would you triple your money in three years probably so then don't worry about what you're going to do in 20 years because you're going to be such a different person than anyways you might not even want to be in the same thing forever and
(03:52) so i think sometimes we just create this reason because the real reason is that we fear failing when something seems so easy right we fear failing because we might not think we're good enough or we're being lazy and we don't want to even start or try and so it's usually the fear thing but for some people you shouldn't get off your ass um but anyways i hope i i hope you found this valuable uh maybe this you're at a decision right now where you're thinking about investing something or you're thinking about taking advantage of an
(04:20) opportunity or think about investing your time into uh taking advantage of some sort of inefficiency and uh if it's a massive one even if it's going to be fleeting as long as the return is high enough i think many times it can be worth it so anyways this is more targeted for newer entrepreneurs if you're in an existing vehicle it means you've already found an arbitrary opportunity so don't try and do another one unless it's something that feeds your original model but anyways i hope that makes sense keep being awesome have a fantastic day and
(04:51) i'll catch you next video bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) welcome to the call today i want to open the floor up to ask you guys because i'm sure because it's been it's been 30 days since last time we spoke so if you guys have questions in the chat burning burning things decisions that are impending things you are unsure about strategies that you need to validate or even just a a verbal high five please put in the chat i'll go i'll go from top to bottom and then we'll rock and roll from there mr pittman question that leans on philosophical meaning of lifestyle what's sure let's uh let's let's rock it let's
(00:34) do it so in your podcast you talk a lot about the um like how happiness is like the equation of like warrants versus needs and like i had a million cash in the bank but i was living off of 30 grand or something like that and so like were you have you always just been predisposed to wanting less or is that like a skill that you learn because most people are like yo i want to make millions and millions of dollars so that i can get more at least that's kind of like where i was the direction i was going until i like started listening to you and now i'm
(01:09) thinking like um you know and so i'm just curious to know like if that was just like a natural like predisposition that you had or you like got to a certain point to where you're like okay now that i've experienced more i want less like how did that all kind of play out because i think it would help me become more happy man that's a loaded question it has probably been what that question has been the the primary thing that's occupied my myspace in the last 18 months and so for context i don't talk as much publicly about what we do
(01:42) but like between our all of the companies that we own we're doing just under two million a week like i don't need to take these calls right i do these things because like they're the few things that i drive joy from like i love you know like i like hearing peter's updates i like karen patrick knowing that he's he's he's moving you know for the chiropractor business and jason's finally getting his [ __ ] legion uh is set up and mack you're doing your own dance thing which is sick you know what i mean and michael i know i remember
(02:08) your first sale like that that is where i find meaning and so i think first off if you redefine the term from happiness which is which is based on outside circumstances you are happy as a reaction joy comes from within which means that i can be sad and sorrowful and filled with joy you can mourn and be joyful because joyful as an ex is how you choose to experience the circumstances so first i would redefine the word that you're shooting for right the second thing is is asking like but why right and so a lot of us want to make money
(02:38) because we're like i want to you know and and then and then when we talk publicly it's like i want to leave a legacy i want to leave an impact blah blah blah right all that stuff i want to help people but the reality is that everything that you do that is external achievement is ephemeral and what it means is it literally only exists on the physical plane and that physical claim is temporary which means it will end which means that all of the achievements and all the things that you're doing on this plane literally by definition will have no
(03:07) lasting impact and so if it means that nothing that you do any all the things that you accomplish and all the things or rather the wealth that you accumulate will eventually disappear it changes the perspective somewhat and so the way that i like to think about it is the analogy of a casino and so i think all of us are given a token when we're you know when we come of age and start to get into the game and we sit down at a table and we play and we play and we play and we play and the players around the table are
(03:34) bragging about how their how big their chips are some players win some players lose and more more chips get stacked right but the difference between that casino and the casino of life is that at the end of the day you leave the table with your chips still on it and you don't cash out and then everyone takes the chips that you had there so you're playing a fake game with fake money and so i think when you realize that like you can buy a castle you can buy a house and there's a person in india who has no shoes who has more joy in their life you
(04:09) realize that none of the things that we do to accomplish serve any real meaning whatsoever they really just act as the shovel that we use to dig the holes that we're going to fill back up at the end of the day when we die and so it's like what shovel do you want to use to dig your hole and so i like to think of those things as what things do i inherently find joy in and so for me i enjoy learning and i learn through teaching and so that is how i derive meaning and the only thing that i can dedicate my life to that is
(04:49) eternal are things that will last past the physical plane which are values and so if you can shift your decision-making process from outcome-based decision-making process to value-based decision-making process you'll always feel in alignment with your identity and so for me when i experience alignment between what i truly believe what i say and what i do i feel like i'm acting in the way that i that is in alignment with who i am and so i think that a lot of us have made decisions or say things that are contrary to what we
(05:22) believe or we do things that are contrary to what we say we do things contrary to what we think and we experience dissonance and that's most of our lives and so i think that if you can free yourself into thinking i can i believe these things to be true i say them with certainty and my life is a reflection of those things which i believe to be to be meaningful and i can dedicate my life to that eternal value and that value will exist after i die and so that for me is is is kind of where i derive meaning from work
(05:57) that was helpful um yeah i was real big how have you defined your values though you know like did you like sit on a stone say like i value integrity and courage and like what does what does that look like and how does that play i mean obviously if you do business you're doing it with integrity and courage or whatever your values are but like how do you make if you think about it there's a lot of times where where we we sacrifice we cut a small corner right and so where we cut the small corners a lot of times it's not
(06:34) anything that anyone else would notice it's just that we know it like you make the email campaign and you just know you didn't do your best you just wanted to get it done right you made the ad and you didn't really go through the process that you know you should be going through right you made the the vsl and you just tried to knock it out because it was on your to-do list rather than thinking like i'm going to make this truly excellent and so every time you do that you live outside of the values that you have for
(06:58) yourself and so i think that like you you feel like you live in alignment when what you say to others about what you believe is actually what you do and so yes sure we all believe in being honest sure we all believe in trying hard sure we all believe in doing your best but no one [ __ ] does man i out work everyone was like go to [ __ ] china where they work six days a week 12 hours a day and that is their 40 hour work week and tell me how hard you work i work the weekend you're so hardcore right and then why is working even
(07:40) considered something that's laudable right laudable like why is it why is that even anything because like we're supposed to be doing things that we enjoy that we derive meaning from so why should we be louded for doing things that we find joy like that we derive joy from just interesting thoughts but um anyways michael that's um that's my that's my two cents on it

(00:00) the decrease in price never equates to the corresponding increase in sales i'll give you one hard learned example that i had my employees two years ago bitched and moaned about how they thought we were too expensive soul crushing right because they were like our churn is 15 month over month right it's terrible it's it's it's yeah heartbreaking and we had been there for like a year they're like i think we got to lower our price so we said we're going to go from 800 a week to 600 a week that was going to be our price drop we
(00:36) made this big announcement right big announcement super excited not only that we're going to give a discount and add coaching services on top so we're going to give more for less just crazy over delivery first off i got complaints from clients because they were upset that they had paid more number two i cut my profit by 400 dollars a month and my churn remained the same wow so that series of employees lost me five million dollars wow and you do not have to learn that lesson

(00:00) so if you look at the the wealthiest people in the world most of them made their money in punctuated periods of time and so there are these these gaps of arbitrage that get exposed for that i mean that thing like no opportunities forever right you get these periods of time where there's disproportionate return on investment right kevin harrington made all of his money because a certain period of time he was able to get infomercial time eight hours a day for free for three years they just had no one they had no programming
(00:29) so he literally ran infomercials for eight hours a day on national television for free and just killed it he had no cost of acquisition he literally sold for eight hours a day on national television and the majority of his money was made from that and then the rest of his life has been like trying to find little pockets right mark cuban made most of his thing on one sale kevin o'leary yeah most of it on one deal right and so there are these arbitrage opportunities that open up and they close and what we have to do as entrepreneurs is
(00:57) look at the skills that we need to have so we have a full stack of skills so that when that door opens we can go all in and put everything on black you

Reopening the Right Way (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOKl6dodMTg

Transcript:
(00:00) going everyone uh welcome back so i want to make this uh video because i uh in our community was talking yesterday about the math behind how to know how many sessions you should have uh as you're reopening to make sure that you are profitable the issues that's going to come up is a lot of different states they have different recommendations some of them are based on percentage of capacity uh you know reopening through covet some of them are uh you know limited to 10 people or it's the greater of the two or the lesser of the two
(00:27) excuse me um and so what that does is it it it creates a lot of issues for most gyms because the profit model is not built for large group training to not be able to do large group training all right and so what i mean by that is if you're charging let's say five dollars a session or ten dollars a session for what it would work out to in terms of the attendance for your hundred dollar a month clients if you're only able to have ten people per session at your facility that would include you and probably one other person so now you're
(00:58) down to eight now if you're providing one-on-eight service it doesn't make monetary sense for you to to be in business right so even though you get permission to open back up it doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to have the profit to be able to do so so if you were to come back to your full client schedule uh when you come back you probably won't be profitable and so this is how you reopen the right way okay so there's two main components to this and i'll go through each one as in depth as i can all right the first
(01:29) is what i was mentioning just now if you're only able to have 10 people per session then you need to price your services at the price that that service would be normally offered so if people are normally paying 129 a month at your facility or 150 a month or whatever for unlimited and you're only able to have 60 people a day at your gym if you had six sessions a day for example those sessions you can't even have 60 because you're going to be included in that so now you're talking you know 50 people a day that you can service which
(02:00) means you can only service 50 customers all right so if you're having a one on eight scenario then you need to charge 300 or 400 a month for that service as long as that happens now here's the good news the people who will want to come back are going to be itching to come back not everyone is going to come back but the people who do want to come back desperately want to come back and so they'll likely you'll have the supply demand curve in your favor meaning there's more people who want you then there is availability of time for you to
(02:28) be able to train clients all right and so when you have supply and demand in your favor then it means you can increase your price right and so those things work together for kind of scenario one okay if you are limited and can't do like that many people per session etc okay you need to adjust your price to reflect the level of service being provided not just letting people back into their old price because it doesn't make monetary sense okay now what i'm going to do is talk about the second piece which is how do i know when
(02:55) it makes monetary sense so one of the things in the gym one secrets book in section two which is the profit levers which i would highly encourage you to read before you reopen because it'll allow you to fix everything that you did wrong in your gym this is one of the biggest opportunities of all time for people who own a gym because right now society is giving you permission to change all these things in your gym at once and then restart the right way with the right price points the right hours the right amount of people per session
(03:23) all of those things done right so that you can maximize the profit and capacity of facility all right so this is like never before will you be able to get this opportunity so take it please take 35 minutes and read section 2 of the gym on secrets book it's free plus shipping go read it all right now here's the here's one of the biggest pieces that i have to provide for you okay you want to make sure that you're making an 80 gross margin minimum on your services all right this is this has been a rule of thumb that we've used at gym
(03:54) launch forever if you are running on that then you will be able to make a profit and have a good business if you do not and you're like well we're at 75 i'm telling you every percentage point makes an enormous difference so let me give you an example if the average gym is running on twelve and a half percent margins per year all right that's the average gem if you go from 75 to 83 margins then you added eight percent to your bottom line so if you went from 12 to 20 that would be a very big deal right it'd be almost twice as much money
(04:21) so these percentage points matter all right so for us now mind you you can set the number whatever you want my rule of thumb is minimum 80. if you want to be at 85 or 90 by all means go for it all right you could it's your business you can set it up the right way but let me walk through a simple math example to explain to you exactly how many sessions you can know by math that you can reopen at any given moment okay so if you have let's say 150 customers before this and then you reach out to all of them and
(04:49) only 100 want to come back cool so let's say those hundred who have said yes i want to come back you can build my card now all right are billing at a hundred dollars a month i don't recommend that price point but i'm saying if that is what they're saying then that's what we're going to work off of for the for the money math all right so that's ten thousand dollars a month of recurring revenue that you have built in now if you're running an 80 gross margin that means that on the cost of delivering the services that doesn't
(05:14) include rent that doesn't include admin it doesn't include marketing just your hard cost of fulfilling a session all right is 20 or less of what you are paying or what you are making okay so what that means is if you're making ten thousand dollars a month for your services then it should cost you two thousand dollars a month or less to fulfill those services so if we know that we only have two thousand dollars that's earmarked for payroll for fulfillment of those services and you know it costs you twenty dollars per session then it means
(05:47) you have a hundred sessions that you are able to fulfill on per month now if we're going to be smart about this then we're going to divide our 100 sessions by 4.3 which is how many weeks there are per month on average which means we have 23 sessions per week that you're going to be able to fulfill all right given the number of people and the amount of revenue that's being brought in that is already happening all right don't go off of promises i'm begging you go off of reality all right you're going to have like some people's cars won't go through
(06:16) because things have changed over the last two months some people say they're going to come back and then don't some people are like actually gotta wait for my kids blah blah blah all right go only off of reality go off of what goes through so you get everyone in you start their billing and then you see what happens and then you dictate the schedule right if you can do that if you can't then you're gonna have to down downgrade your estimation by how much you were making before with all the cancellations included and then drop
(06:40) another 10 just in case and then use that as the number to base this off of so 10 000 2 dollars for payroll that means if we're getting twenty dollars a session that's a hundred sessions we divide that that's per month by uh the number of weeks in a month which is uh four point three so we have 23 sessions per week okay and so you can allocate those let's say that we've got five days a week monday through friday that might be normal hours all right so on those days let's say we did four sessions a day two in the morning two in
(07:10) the afternoon so now we got 20 we got three left over and so we can go three on saturday right in the morning if that's what we wanted to do right and so just like that you can get your payroll you can get your business to a point where you have an 80 gross margin or higher right and so like i said that is the minimum but that is the way that you can know in your gut that you're opening up in a position to be profitable now if you've done the math and you're like you know what i can only have 10 000 a month recurring and my rent is six
(07:40) well then you're probably not going to start out profitable anyways and so at that point you're going to have to make harder decisions of like do i want to uh do you want to do a big pre-sale and then get another you know 50 or 100 people pre-sold on a trial to to be able to monetize this um and that's where cash is really important right but big picture most of you don't have that situation um and if you did have that kind of rent then hopefully your revenue is higher than that and hopefully your price is higher than that
(08:06) etcetera but that's how you that's how you can figure this out and most people do this wrong most people are like i'm gonna try and open up as many available times right or the worst scenario you can have is and this is what i feel like it's gonna happen for a ton of people is i'm gonna be limited to 10 people per session i've got 100 clients i'm going to increase my overhead so that i can have 10 sessions a day so i can see all my clients and there goes your margin forever and then how do you transition back and having to
(08:33) cut sessions right it's not a good way to do it start as little as you can start with two sessions eight start with ninety percent margins right that's fine it's okay start with 90 margins work at two sessions a day and work your way back start at three sessions a day whatever right and so from there um this is one of those beautiful opportunities that if you ever had that session that never really had good attendance right cut it right cut it get your margin back right and uh like i just want everyone like think kovit like sure there are things
(09:04) that you probably wish didn't happen okay but but take what you can right right now you can click reset on your business these are the five things that you need to do right now all right i'm going to give you the the cliff notes on what you need to do one you need to switch from unlimited to two or three times a week as your main offer all right because right away that'll double or triple your capacity two you need to switch your billing to a weekly cadence now it doesn't have to actually be weekly but it has to be on a weekly bi-weekly or
(09:29) four-time or every four-week cadence why because if you do it on every 28 days you're going to get 13 billions a year instead of 12 which means you get an extra almost eight percent in top line revenue for the same amount of service right what that means is if you have a 12 margin you get another eight percent now you're at 20.
(09:48) all right almost doubles how much you make just from that one change all right each of these levers is like that okay so unlimited to two to three times a week you're going to switch to a billing a cadence of weekly bi-weekly or 28-day cycles you're going to change your pricing to match your service all right which means when you make these adjustments typically uh when you limit people's sessions fewer people show up which then means that the number of people per session goes down which means your value goes up and so that means that you can build
(10:17) more believe it or not because people change it changes the value proposition to the end user so just remember that you're not cutting sessions you're adding value by making it more personalized because the sessions are going to be smaller and more controlled okay and so when you do that my minimum recommendation is 167 all right that's my minimum bare minimum bear bear bear bear bare minimum uh which works out to 39 a week all right bare minimum most people will be at 49 a week or 59 a week or 69 a week okay and that's what
(10:46) you can do for those uh and that's what the overall pricing would be so if you did it at 49 a week uh 49.99 don't forget your 99 cents all right which means you're gonna be 199.99 every 28 days all right beyond that if you typically have uh exercise is that you use that you've wanted to get rid of because they take too much space up and they eat too much square footage this is the time to get rid of those things and take them out of the programming in terms of your sessions instead of being 60 minutes cut them to
(11:18) 45 all right it'll also increase your capacity and decrease your payroll so all of these things are things that you can do right now doing it the right way starting with the right price with the right services the right amount of sessions the right margin so that you can actually come out of this profitable or even more profit than you did before every person who goes in and tries to increase the amount of sessions they're doing keep the pricing the same and then have more individualized service that they're going to do is going to go out
(11:47) right the math doesn't support it and so just like if i can give you one thing just trust the math right you will be able to make a profit be able to provide more value your customers and actually get through this so you can grow your gym which hopefully is your goal so um that's uh that's that's part one of how to reopen the right way is structure everything properly um i'll probably make another video on how to how to market and sell before that but right now make sure to get this stuff right if you get the book there's a letter
(12:15) inside the book on how to communicate the changes um you can literally copy it go for it um it's my gift to you uh but yeah if you don't know where the book is just go to alexisbook.com um there's a free book there i think it's on amazon too if you do by the way leave a review lots of love um anyways happy wednesday wanted to make sure i got that out for you and uh keep being awesome [Music] you


If You Missed it... I'm Launching Live. Again - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) energy, but what about when things go wrong? I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything about it at all. And I saw it as one of the most important things that you can put in a business. We're trying to do something no one's ever done before.
(00:18) I think a lot of people will see this launch and be like, "Dude, how can I do that?" And I'll just be like, "You can't." Like, I work a lot and this is a lot for me. It's just a lot. We're on the way to the airport. go meet Alex and Laya for a flight because content in the plane typically does better. So, I just grabbed basically every hook that's been working for the existing winners plus a bunch of the organic ones that did well.
(00:45) Yeah, I feel like it just got hotter cuz they turn it off and they turn it back on. Oh, I thought it was I walk in. Ain't easy being easy. So, you're good just witnessing ads. That's what I was told. All right. You guys might want to wait to do ads until we take off is going to be loudest. Yeah, Leila's been a sport, but being not bothered by me just doing ads and doing this BDS while she sits silently.
(01:09) What do you think about the launch? I think it's a good idea. I think what's more interesting is hearing what it's like to prepare for a launch that you know that many people want to watch. I think that's more fascinating than hearing about the book itself. Entrepreneurs like we don't get a lot of, you know, honestly, we just get on most of the time. Like we get told we're bad people.
(01:27) And so I wanted to make an event by us for us to help solve as many of those problems I possibly can in one day. Were you sleeping much? No. Actually, I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping. I'll tell you my last door. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Sean says old man reapers knocking. Old man Mosie. 5 hours and 45 minutes last night. 5 hours and 20 the night before. 5 hours and 17 the night before that. 7:45. That was Saturday.
(01:52) Yeah, that was on my birthday. Yeah, that was your birthday. At the volume we're doing the ads, it sounds like it'll be Yeah. At this point, no red flags really. We're just on standby to see what data just says they're going to send us some data tomorrow. So, there's a little more statistical significance.
(02:10) So, then we'll turn around ad creative for both Wednesday's shoot and also the private jet ads on Friday. All right. Great. Fireworks. I'll see you guys. A lot of business owners think that they need to change something about their business or get into a different business because they're not making as much as they think they should or want to. And a huge part of that is your actual money model. It's your monetization structure, how you collect money, how you charge for what you do.
(02:41) So I started writing money models in 2021. I had a mentor who told me that I should document like the artifact or the crystallized knowledge of that. I took that advice and I ended up writing just this massive tone that was 400 something pages and uh that's what became um all three of the $und00 million uh books and so many models is offering the right thing at the right time in the right way to the right customer and that takes a little bit of practice but that's exactly why I wrote the book right now there's just a lot of
(03:14) different pieces going on it's like we've got inventory stuff going to warehouses we've got um other surprise little bonuses that are also traveling around the world. And I enjoy this. Like this is the this is why most people don't do it and this is why most people don't win.
(03:33) But like I outline those details so that it's uh kind of clear like, oh, there's there's more than one thing that happens. It's not like Alex is just going to go on YouTube live and be like, hey, I have a new book. We're on our way to North Vegas to go to the warehouse, um Money Models Book Warehouse to check out inventory. Alex Le on the way there right now. So yeah, we'll see how it goes. What's up? Ready? Hi there.
(03:57) How's it going? Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks for having us for today. We want to make sure we hit what I don't see this inventory. Couple pictures. We're striving very, very aggressively to get all of the shipments out within 72 hours, which is just a herculean feat because I think we're going to pass all of the launch sales that we did last time before we even release the book this time.
(04:16) I can bring. Yeah. All right. How many How many pallets do you guys have? I'm not going to ask you to take all the pallets down. I'm just I just want to have an understanding. I think we just take one pallet down and then we'll just film it and call it a day. Well, 240,000 divided by 3 is 80. There's 24 in a box.
(04:34) So, how many people will be here to like actually move the product? What's what's kind of the tenative plan for getting Cuz I mean, I do that math like, okay, 10 guys. I don't know what how many how many books a minute somebody can put out cuz last year we had 30 and they goting hammered and this will be five times bigger than last year.
(04:56) Now this time we are distributing between three different warehouses across the US. That way we can get it to you guys faster. We have 300 plus support staff that are going to be here for the launch. We have installed uh really exceptional AI. It's just a lot. It's a lot because we have high standards. It really just comes down to that.
(05:14) It's a lot because we want it to be exceptional for everyone at any touch point, any surface area that you're exposed to at the brand. All right, so we're opening this bad boy up. Somebody's going to get a a lucky uh a lucky copy. Our goal is to get 1,800 more of these pallets of books, and we're going to try and do it in 24 hours, which is absolutely absurd. So, like, we're we're here and we haven't started promoting it yet. Yeah. At all. From that's an email. One email.
(05:38) It's one of those things that we can definitely flex some. So, no, I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Stephen. So, we just got out of the warehouse. Um, just double checking on numbers for pallets and books and what's going to get pre-kitted and making sure that they're staffed up so that they can uh handle the volume. Obviously, this is not all the locations. It's one of many.
(05:57) So, we're have a meeting tomorrow and centralized with leadership and make sure that uh it's fully staffed so that we can uh accommodate it. Thank you guys for all coming. I appreciate it. I'm Alex Ramoszi. That's where it starts. So, it's like I'm Alexi.
(06:14) This is my 100 book launch and then we like rock and roll, right? Yeah. Those ads are actually already done. Um, we finished the 40 or so that we filmed. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take the best hooks that are still that will still work. Yeah. Great. So, last launch there was no um there was no offer to liquidate ad spend. Uh, and so I just fronted the money for the advertising.
(06:36) Um this one I'm demonstrating the concept of the book which is a money model. So basically how do you pull cash forward accelerate cash conversion uh within a business so that you can scale and so I want to demonstrate that with the launch. So that's what I'm doing. And so basically the goal is to spend as much money as humanly possible uh while maintaining break even or better.
(06:56) And the end result should be more good people knowing about it. So this one should be bigger than the last one. We'll find out as long as ad accounts and you know all that stuff works way. You know, we hope. And look, there it is. Are you having fun making these ads? Dude, I've done so many ads. Yeah, I feel like it's Groundhog Day.
(07:15) I'm numb. I feel nothing anymore. 1400 ads in. Yeah, dude. It's like I've done 2,000 of these. Brick and mortar business owners, if right now you're struggling to get leads in the door, give me the next 30 seconds. You have a better model, you can outspend. If you have a better model, you can out purchase talent to get the best people in the business.
(07:33) I've got all these green guys behind me who are excited, too. And hopefully you'll see us there. Let's just start from there and walk back again. You said the lighting's better. All right, let's walk back. Yeah. All right. So, let's reverse. Ready? All right. Have you ever woken up and been completely fed up with your business? I'm releasing my 100 million money bottles book, but you got to be there live.
(07:57) Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate that. You coming to the book launch? Uh, where's it at? It's live. It's just virtual. August 16th. August 16th. Yeah. Well, hope to see you there. No, you bet. See, this is why we advertise. No one knows. We think We think we're so important. No one knows. No one knows. Alex, let's just maximize as much space as we can.
(08:38) Alex's not enough room in this town for the both of us. So, the other option is it's only the me screen and then that is here. Could you try the one where it's one full screen with the deck next to me? A zillion different vendors and my own team and support from even portfolio companies. All of that for a 72-hour window. Kind of like watching fire.
(09:01) In principle, you can make both of the screens bigger. There's been so many decisions. Like, it's it's it's insane the amount of decisions that have to happen. Perfect. Very difficult to get the attention of an entire audience for a very short period of time.
(09:19) And so, you know, how well things go is a is a huge hat tip to the brand. And so, I I want it to go well. We just want to blow people away and I know over the long haul it always comes back. Where will I see the countdown timer? When we do it though, I won't have that fee because I don't want to see myself. Yeah, I don't want to see my phone.
(09:36) All right, so we back to live thing or is there any other um pending decisions? Um it's just one of the email people have to be able to click and then it has to work. So YouTube I think can handle that kind of traffic and if YouTube can't handle it then it's a high pressure situation. This is where our core values matter the most because how we conduct ourselves under this pressure.
(09:55) We have to remember one thing that will get us through all of this. We are all on the same team. When we have pressure, when there's something on the line, when it's the game, that's when it matters. And so this is where we get to flex our muscle to show up the best of ourselves and for our teammates. We'll be mindful of it. I feel pretty confident. Ooh, I kind of like this.
(10:12) Everyone got what they need? All right, rock and roll. I think it's going to go well, though. It's going to be a roller coaster ride. All right, guys. We're going live in one. There's a couple things, you know, that are that are going on. I think it's just the level of effort is portion of the goal. Okay. When you fast forward life and you get to your 80s, 90s, and hopefully 1000s, or whatever we get to live to, um I think when we look back, there's not really that much of your life that you remember. So, you just have a couple snapshots, a couple moments that stick,
(10:42) or we were attempting to do something that no one has ever done before. And I think that's cool. So I think we approach it with that level of seriousness. Seriousness in terms of our commitment, our dedication to being excellent.
(11:04) Um obviously when everyone's watching, but most importantly when everyone and a lot of the work that everyone can see today comes from a lot of work that no one saw. So for everyone who did work that no one saw, thank you. Um and I think it's going to be really sick. [Music] All right. Ready? I am kneede in just a bunch of different facets of the launch.
(11:48) You know, it's a few hours for everyone who shows up, but it's like multiple years of preparation that we're doing. The fortunate thing that we have is that last time the lead's launch was a great dry run for this one. There was basically six or seven breaking points that we identified that were like choke points within the whole thing. And so, it's basically trying to stand up the infrastructure of like a Fortune 10 company for a week.
(12:05) Dude, it's wild. This is a [ __ ] deck, man. You said 1600 slides. Yeah. It's going to be a [ __ ] trip, man. Everyone thinks about like what happens when it goes right? That's celebrating. We're so excited. There's all this energy, but what about when things go wrong? I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything about it at all.
(12:28) And I saw it as one of the most important things that you can put in a business. We're trying to do something no one's ever done before. I think a lot of people will see this launch and be like, "Dude, how can I do that?" And I'll just be like, "You can't." Like, I work a lot and this is a lot for me. It's just a lot. We're on the way to the airport.
(12:48) Go meet Alex and Ila for a flight cuz content in the plane typically does better. So, I just grabbed basically every host that's been working for the existing winners plus a bunch of the organic ones that did well. Yeah, I feel like it just got hotter cuz they turn it off and they turn back on. Oh, I thought it was cuz I walked in. Ain't easy being easy. So, you're good just witnessing ads? That's what I was told.
(13:11) All right. You guys might want to wait to do ads until we take off. It's been loudest. Yeah, Leila's been a sport being not bothered by me just doing ads and doing this BDS while she sits silently. What do you think about the launch? I think it's a good idea. I think what's more interesting is hearing what it's like to prepare for a launch that you know that many people want to watch. I think that's more fascinating than hearing about the book itself.
(13:37) entrepreneurs like we don't get a lot of, you know, honestly we just get on most of the time like we get told we're bad people and so I wanted to make an event by us for us to help solve as many of those problems I possibly can in one day. Are you sleeping much? No, I actually I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping. I'll tell you my last foot's door. I know.
(13:54) Yeah. Sean says old man first knock 5 hours and 45 minutes last night. 5 hours and 20 the night before. 5 hours and 17 the night before that. 7:45. That was Saturday. Yeah, that was on her birthday. Yeah, that was your birthday. At the volume we're doing the ads, it sounds like it'll be Yeah. No red flags really.
(14:18) We're just on standby to see what data just says they're going to send us some data tomorrow, so there's a little more statistical significance. So then we'll turn around ad creative for both Wednesday's shoot and also the private jet ads on Friday. All right, great. Fireworks. I'll see you guys. A lot of business owners think that they need to change something about their business or get into a different business because they're not making as much as they think they should or want to.
(14:51) And a huge part of that is your actual money model. It's your monetization structure. How you collect money, how you charge for what you do. So, I started writing money models in 2021. I had a mentor who told me that I should document like the artifact or the crystallized knowledge of that.
(15:11) I took that advice and I ended up writing just this massive tone that was 400 something pages and uh that's what became um all three of the $100 million uh books and so many models is offering the right thing at the right time in the right way to the right customer. And that takes a little bit of practice but that's exactly why I wrote the book. Right now there's just a lot of different pieces going on. It's like we've got inventory stuff going to warehouses.
(15:36) We've got um other surprise little bonuses that are also traveling around the world. And I enjoy this. Like this is the this is why most people don't do it and this is why most people don't win. But like I outline those details so that it's uh kind of clear like oh there's there's more than one thing that happens. It's not like Alex is just going to go on YouTube live and be like hey I have a new book.
(15:56) We're on our way to North Vegas to go to the warehouse. um Money Models Book Warehouse to check out inventory. Alex on the way there right now. So yeah, we'll see how it goes. What's up? What's up? Ready? Hi there. How's it going? Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks for having us for today. We want to make sure we hit what I know. See some of the inventory on the couple pictures.
(16:20) We're striving very, very aggressively to get all of the shipments out within 72 hours, which is just a herculean feat because I think we're going to pass all of the launch sales that we did last time before we even release the book this time. Yeah. All right. How many How many pallets do you guys have? I'm not going to ask you to take all the pallets down.
(16:38) I'm just I just want to have an understanding. I think we just take one pallet down and then we'll just film it and call it a day. Well, it's 240,000 divided by 3 is 80. There's 24 in a box. So, how many people will be here to like actually move the product? What's what's kind of the tenative plan for getting cuz I mean I do that math like okay 10 guys.
(17:01) I don't know what how many how many books a minute somebody can put out cuz last year we had 30 and they goting hammered and this will be five times bigger than last year. Now, this time we are distributing between three different warehouses across the US. That way, we can get it to you guys faster.
(17:19) We have 300 plus support staff that are going to be here for the launch. We have installed uh really exceptional AI. It's just a lot. It's a lot because we have high standards. It really just comes down to that. It's a lot because we want it to be exceptional for everyone at any touch point, any surface area that you're exposed to at the brand. All right, so we're opening this bad boy up.
(17:36) Somebody's going to get a a lucky uh a lucky copy. Our goal is to get 1,800 more of these pallets of books and we're going to try and do it in 24 hours, which is absolutely absurd. So, like we're we're here and we haven't started promoting it yet. Yeah. At all from that's an email. One email. It's one of those things that we can definitely flex off. So, no, I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Stephen.
(18:01) So, we just got out of the warehouse. um just double checking on numbers for pallets and books and what's going to get prekitted and making sure that they're staffed up so that they can uh handle the volume. Obviously, this is not all the locations is one of many. So, we're have a meeting tomorrow and centralized with leadership and make sure that uh it's fully staffed so that we can uh accommodate it. Thank you guys for all coming. I appreciate it.
(18:25) I'm Alex Sherosi. That's where it starts. So, it's like I'm Alexi. This is my under book launch. And then we like rock and roll, right? Yeah. Those ads are actually already done. Um, we finished the 40 or so that we filmed. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take the best hooks that are still that will still work.
(18:41) Yeah. Glad to. Great. So, last launch there was no um there was no offer to liquidate ad spend. Uh, and so I just fronted the money for the advertising. Um, this one I'm demonstrating the concept of the book, which is a money model.
(19:00) So basically how do you pull cash forward accelerate cash conversion uh within a business so that you can scale and so I want to demonstrate that with the launch. So that's what I'm doing and so basically the goal is to spend as much money as humanly possible uh while maintaining break even or better and the end result should be more good people knowing about it. So this one should be bigger than the last one.
(19:19) We'll find out as long as ad accounts and you know all that stuff works the way you know we hope. Look, there it is. Are you having fun making these ads? Dude, I've done so many ads. Yeah, I feel like it's Groundhog Day. I'm numb. I feel nothing anymore. 1400 ads in. Yeah, dude. It's like I've done 2,000 of these. Brick and mortar business owners, if right now you're struggling to get leads in the door, give me the next 30 seconds.
(19:43) You have a better model, you can outspend. If you have a better model, you can out purchase talent to get the best people in the business. I've got all these green guys behind me who are excited, too. And hopefully you'll see us there. Let's just start from there and walk back again. You said the lighting's better. All right, let's walk back. Yeah. All right. So, let's reverse. You know, ready? All right.
(20:02) Have you ever woken up and been completely fed up with your business? I'm releasing my 100 million Money Bubbles book, but you got to be there live. Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate that. You coming to the book launch? Uh, where's it at? It's live. It's just virtual. August 16th. August 16th. Check it out. Well, I'll see you there. No, you bet.
(20:25) See, this is why we advertise. No one knows. We think We think we're so important. No one knows. No one knows. Alex, let's just maximize as much space as we can. Alex's not enough room in this town for the both of us. So, the other option is it's only the me screen and then that is here. Could you try the one where it's one full screen with the deck next to me? a zillion different vendors and my own team and support from even portfolio companies. All of that for a 72-hour window.
(21:13) Kind of like watching fire. In principle, you can make both of the screens bigger. There's been so many decisions. Like it's it's it's insane the amount of decisions that have to happen. Perfect. Very difficult to get the attention of an entire audience for a very short period of time.
(21:32) And so, you know, how well things go is a is a huge hat tip to the brand. And so, I I want it to go well. We just want to blow people away. And I know over the long haul, it always comes back. Where will I see the countdown timer? When we do it though, I won't have that fee cuz I don't want to see myself. Yeah. I don't want to see myself. All right.
(21:50) So, we back to live thing or is there any other um pending decisions? Um, it's just one of the email. People have to be able to click and then it has to work. So YouTube I think can handle that kind of traffic and if YouTube can't handle it then it's a high pressure situation.
(22:09) This is where our core values matter the most because how we conduct ourselves under this pressure we have to remember one thing that will get us through all of this. We're all in the same team. When we have pressure when there's something on the line when it's the game that's when it matters. And so this is where we get to flex our muscle to show up the best of ourselves and for our teammates. We'll be mindful of that. But I feel pretty confident.
(22:26) Ooh I kind of like this. Everyone got what they need? All right, rock and roll. I think it's going to go well, though. It's going to be a roller coaster ride. All right, guys. We're going live in one. There's a couple things, you know, that are that are going on. I think it's just the level of effort is portion of the goal. Okay.
(22:45) When you fast forward life and you get to your 80s, 90s, and hopefully 1000s, or whatever we get to live to, um, I think when we look back, there's not really that much of your life that you remember. So you just have a couple snapshots, a couple moments that stick where we're attempting to do something that no one has ever done before. And I think that's cool.
(23:06) So I think we approach it with that level of seriousness. Seriousness in terms of our commitment, our dedication to being excellent. Um obviously when everyone's watching, but most importantly when everyone. And a lot of the work that everyone can see today comes from a lot of work that no one saw.
(23:25) So, for everyone who did work that no one solved, thank you. Um, and I think it's going to be really sick. [Music] [Music]
(27:24) [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, Heat.
(29:23) It's [Music] time. [Music] The $100 million Money Models Book Launch is finally here. Welcome to the stage, Alex. [Applause] All right. Can we cut off the feed that's uh the one that's showing showing me? Well, guys, the rumors are true. We broke the all-time uh non-fiction fastest selling book launch record ever.
(30:17) Uh and uh Money Models as of right now is the number five on the alltime all book list only topped by Harry Potter four, five, six, and seven. Um which is pretty insane. And so I just want to say thank you guys. And so I want to take you guys through the presentation that broke the Guinness World Record. for a bunch of you guys who missed it.
(30:43) I got a zillion DMs and um I'm going to move this guy so that I can actually walk around. There we go. Great. And uh let's party. All right, I'm Alex Shimoszi. Welcome to my $100 million Money Models book launch event. If you're anything like me, you know that businesses need money to grow.
(31:02) So, I'm going to show you the art of getting more customers to spend more money in less time again and again. But I want to warn you, this isn't a promise that you're going to become rich, fabulous, or fabulously rich or get any other result. Everyone is different. Scaling your business, like everything else in life worth doing, involves risk. And most people do nothing at all.
(31:19) So, your results will vary. So, if you see text like this at the bottom of the screen, it's there to remind you of that fact. And that's why I make free content every day to help you, the entrepreneur, to scale your business and make your results as good as I reliably can. And in the spirit of that, this is the biggest free book launch event to help entrepreneurs and business owners I've ever put on and maybe the biggest one in history. We'll see. But I'm no saint.
(31:44) I want to make money just like you. And I do all this so I can someday invest in your company and scale it because scaling companies like yours by installing new money models is how I make my money. To give you an idea, let me tell you something insane. I sold three companies I started as a kid. Two of them at $46.
(32:02) 2 $2 million in an allcash deal to American Pacific Group. Then I took that money and invested in new companies which I've since scaled under our holding company Acquisition.com. For context, the businesses in Acquisition.com's portfolio did in aggregate over $250 million in revenue in 2024. To give you an idea, if Acquisition.
(32:24) com were a publicly traded company today, it would be in the top 15% of all 51,000 publicly traded companies when we use net income as a measuring stick. So me saying this may create envy in some, anger in others, skepticism in most, and confusion in old people, and inspire a select few. You, the entrepreneur, the business owner, are who I made these money models for. It's also why my wife and I made it our mission to make real business education accessible for everyone. Cool. Great.
(32:48) Now you're all caught up. But you're not here for my story. You're here to take the next step in yours. So here's what I'll show you today. how good money models get more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again. And when that happens, your business scales as fast as you can handle.
(33:07) That said, money models work for marketing agencies, online businesses, real estate, financial services, insurance, home services, local businesses, consumer services, automotive, healthcare, software, e-learning, e-commerce, and anything that sells stuff to anyone. And I know they work because of two inarguable truths. Number one, I know they work because I use them in our portfolio companies today, which include financial services, business services, consumer services, local businesses, software, e-commerce, and more. And two, no matter how complex a money model looks, there's only four
(33:30) types of stuff you can sell. Software, information, services, physical products, and money models work in all of them, which if your business sells stuff, includes yours. I've used money models my whole life. They got me to where I am. Everything I've accomplished, I have a money model to thank for it, including a Guinness World Record.
(33:53) So, I know this works from experience and not theory. So, I'm going to deliver to two types of people today. Number one, the up andcoming entrepreneurs. You need to put on your oxygen mask and take care of yourself and your family first. I promise you, I'll help you get closer to that two-day for free period. So, you're going to want to stay till the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time. You have my word.
(34:11) And number two, the business owners, the players, the money makers. I'm going to make it in your best interest to help me help everyone else. And if you decide to join me, I'll show you how we can accomplish both our goals together. So, here's what we're going to cover in our short time together today. Number one, what you're going to get for being here. Number two, what kills 82% of businesses.
(34:30) As much as I'd love to say it's hard work, it's not that. Number three, the one thing that makes a business impossible to kill. And number four, how to apply it to your business today. So, let's start with the first, what you're going to get for being here. So, let me address the elephant in the room.
(34:47) Am I really going to give everyone here live a secret project they've been working on for four years that's better than an NFT and less than a Bitcoin? And the answer is yes, a thousand%. And every single person here live today will get one for free. But I won't tell you what it is yet. You will have to stay and find out if you don't already know. But just so you know, that's legit. This is something that I will sell.
(35:06) And at the end of this live stream, I'll tell you I can get it for free. So, you can watch out for that because y'all are still joining me again today live. Now, to the main event. I never expect you to take my word for how powerful money models are. I want to prove it to you. So, without further ado, $100 million Money Models: How to Make Money.
(35:26) So, let me explain. I'm a big believer in proof. Anyone can make promises. Very few people have proof. In every book I've written to this point, I kept proof front and center. To do that, I make sure each of my books walks their talk. So, they not only tell you what to do, but they also prove what amazing things can happen if you do it.
(35:47) For offers, I posted and ghosted. There's no fanfare, no launch, nothing. Just a grand slam offer. But the book answered the question, what do I sell? Answer: Offer so good people feel stupid saying no. It proved it could answer that question by demonstrating the concept to Dline, creating a grand slam offer. So, it had a rock bottom introductory price.
(36:10) It included a free course with higher quality stuff than most people's paid stuff with no strings attached, not even an opt-in. Truly available to anyone and everyone. It was high value. $100 offers has what I describe as a high price to value discrepancy. In other words, you got way more than you paid for. And so, $100 offers grew in word of mouth.
(36:29) These are the actual sales numbers right there. You can just see how it continues to scale up. And four years later, it's still a bestseller across multiple categories. This is as of August 25 with 26,000 five-star reviews, which today millions have watched, read, or listened to. All of this undeniable proof that the ideas, principles, and tactics work.
(36:53) And so, after releasing that book in July of 21, I immediately got to work on my next book to answer the next question. Who do I sell my offer to? answer. Leads, aka the strangers who want to buy your stuff. But there was a problem. I'd successfully advertised my whole life, but I just didn't have enough proof in modern day social media. So, I used the next 24 months for one thing, proof.
(37:14) Proof that the stuff I show in 100 million leads actually works to get leads today in the real world and it could work for you, too. So, I applied only the principles and tactics in 100 million leads to grow my audience from just a handful of customers and friends to 5 million plus people.
(37:30) And so, this is where I started on YouTube. This is 24 months later. This is where I started on my podcast. It's 24 months later. But the point is this. This massive growth resulted in 463,167 registration for the leads launch and breaking the internet. All through direct application of the $100 million leads principles, proving that you can use them to average advertise to anything to anyone at scale.
(37:56) And two years later, thanks to $100 million leads, I've gone from a $5 million person audience to a 13 million person audience again. So I use all the principles in this book because they clearly still work. So not only did my own growth prove the book worked, but the mega launch made it undeniable. But something was still missing. Because even if you have the thing to sell, offers, and the people to sell it to, leads, you still have another question to answer, how do you get them to give you money? And ideally, as much as possible in as little time as possible over and over again. Answer: a $100 million money
(38:32) model. But like the other two books, I still needed proof. A way to prove the concepts inside the book undeniably work. So here's my undeniable proof. 100 million money models work. We've sold more books before this launch than we sold in the entire launch last time. So before we went even live yesterday, we had sold more books than the entire launch last time.
(38:58) And we hadn't even released it yet. So now you know I won't publish a book until the book itself serves as its own undeniable proof. That way you don't have to guess, you can know. So, proof that installing a $100 money model into a business can help it generate more cash flow is what you're going to get here today. The next thing to figure out is how to scale it.
(39:22) But instead of asking how do we scale a business to get the most efficient answer, we can use what Uncle Charlie taught us in version and ask how do we kill one? So, that's what we'll cover next. Number two, what kills 82% of businesses? So, when we ask the question, how do we kill a business? Besides giving up, to be clear, there's only one thing. You run out of money.
(39:48) According to a US uh a US a study by the US Bank, a source that I trust, given they have billions of dollars on the line, 82% of businesses fail due to poor cash flow. That's crazy. Said differently, if you've got no money, you've got no business. You can't even pay the annual filing fees to keep your business open without money. And so here's something you probably didn't know. What percentage of businesses do you think lose money every year? 10%.
(40:14) 15%. 18%. Not even close. Try three times that. According to the Federal Reserve, 54% of businesses lose money or break even every year. That means you work 80our weeks year round to miss restful weekends, holidays, school plays, family dinners, birthdays, nights out.
(40:40) all to take on more risk than any person reasonably should and end up poor than you started. It shouldn't be that way. But then you might think, well, the other 46% must be ballin. Guess again. Of the 46% that make any money, what do you think they're taking home? Well, if you listen to Instagram, you think everyone's a millionaire. Nope. What about 250 grand a year? 100 grand a year? 74,000 a year? The median income of US household? Nope.
(41:07) According to the 2024 Census Bureau data, the median income listed on tax returns for a business owner is $48,000. Just a fraction more than San Francisco's minimum wage or to get sued, stolen from, and called the bad guy for trying to make it on your own. That's a problem. And that's what I'm going to help you solve today.
(41:33) And to be clear, even if you're doing well and you're a super baller, everything I'm about to share with you will just help you scale faster. Now, all of this together tells us one thing. If you own a business, then at some point, no matter how hard you work, you'll likely have times where you lose money trying to get and serve new customers.
(41:50) In other words, you spend more money on customers than they spend on you. That's a big problem because if you do that long enough, your business will die. Which brings us to point three. The one thing that makes a business impossible to kill. So, we hit a fork in the road. Either option one, be like most businesses and be limited by cash flow to grow, or option two, get paid a lot fast on repeat and grow as much as you darn well please. A $100 million money model is option two.
(42:18) $100 million money models use a big fancy equation that looks like this. 30-day gross profit is greater than two times CAC plus COGS, which means you make more in the first 30 days from a customer in gross profit than two times the cost of getting them and the cost of delivering to them. But in the real world, it just starts with an offer.
(42:38) An offer is a problem you solve for customers in exchange for money. A money model is a sequence of offers. A $100 million money model is a sequence of offers that make customers spend twice as much on you as you do on them in 30 days or less. And when you do that, you remove cash as a limiter for growth. To do this, 100 million money models use four powerful mechanisms.
(43:01) Number one, attraction offers, which get people to buy, which means more cash upfront. Number two, upsell offers, which get them to spend more, which means even more cash up front. Number three, downsell offers which get them to buy something if they say no, which results in more cash upfront.
(43:19) And number four, continuity offers, which gets them to buy repeatedly, which results in more cash over time. End result, more cash flow from more customers in less time. A $100 million money model. And cash flow is the key. It's the only thing that guarantees you can stay in business. So, let me prove it to you. What do JP Morgan, GE, Ford, MX, Coca-Cola, 3M all have in common? They're all over a hundred years old, which they could only get to by surviving the hardest times and biggest economic shifts in modern history. Things that killed most businesses. They survived World War I, World War II, the
(44:01) Great Depression, advent of the radio, advent of the television, advent of the computer, advent of the internet, advent of social media. And they were only able to survive because they had one thing, cash flow, because they had a better money model. In other words, they kept making money. So if they could survive all that, then it shows us good money models make bad leads, bad customers, bad reviews, bad hires, bad lawsuits, bad economies, and everything else that kills businesses like yours and mine a walk in the park.
(44:35) Said differently, many business owners do everything right except for the one thing that keeps businesses going and growing, making money. In other words, they've got broken money models, which makes all their focus on everything else in their business the same as obsessing over the aerodynamics of a car when in reality the engine doesn't even start.
(45:00) So, if cash flow is the most important thing and a money model is the most powerful way to increase it, how do we make a good one? Well, you build a $100 million money model. So, here's what it looks like when it's right. If you make more offers and more people buy them, you make more money. If you make more money, you can use it to get more customers.
(45:18) If that money comes faster, the faster you can get even more customers. But what if you make your customers twice as valuable, get twice as many of them, and they pay you twice the speed? Answer: Your business grows eight times as fast. But what if you make your customers three times as valuable, you get three times as many of them, and they pay you at three times the speed.
(45:40) Answer: Your business grows 27 times as fast. A 100 million money model is how my gym scaled from zero to six locations in three years as a kid who's 22 years old. How Gym Launch, my second company, scaled from 380,000 a month to 2.2 million a month in 12 months. It's how Prestige Labs, my third company, went from 270,000 a month to 1.6 million a month in six months.
(46:04) A $100 million money model is how Allen, my fourth company, went from 50,000 a month to 1.3 million a month in six months. And this was all before I had a personal brand. I want to make that point clear. This is all before that. With the $100 money model, you can get really big, really profitable, really fast without starting with loads of money or followers and all with just a few tweaks. And that's the concept I'll illustrate for the rest of our time together.
(46:30) That being said, let me show you what happens to a normal business when you add a $100 million money model. So that's what makes a business impossible to kill. Now we get into applying it to your business today. The purpose of this section is to show you two things.
(46:48) Number one, money model mechanisms work in any business because there's only four ways to sell and they work in all of them. Number two, one money model mechanism is all you need to get amazing results. Now, before you think to yourself, I'm not sure this concept applies to my business, which I call special snowflake itis, which you should get looked at. But let me just prove it to you. There's only four ways to sell stuff. Period. Full stop.
(47:13) In person, online, with a salesperson, or a selfch checkout, which gives us salesman in person, salesman online, selfch checkckout in person, selfch checkckout online. So, really quick, identify which one you are in the chat. One, two, three, or four. I can see you guys. Throw it in the chat. One, two, three, or four. Tell me which one you guys are.
(47:41) And no y'all, I'm live. All right, which means that your business can scale using a money model. So great, that's number one. Money model mechanisms work in any business because there's only four ways to sell and they work in all of them. Now we move on to number two. One money model mechanism is all we need to get amazing results.
(48:05) So, as a reminder, here are the four. Attraction offers, which get people to buy. Upsell offers get them to buy more. Downell offers, which get them to buy something if they say no. And then continuity offers, which get them to buy repeatedly. Now, let me prove this to you in the real world. I see the one, two, three, and fours in the chat. You guys are awesome.
(48:25) I'm going to prove each one of you guys how this applies to you. All right. So, let's break down a consumer service money model with a salesman in person. So, my number ones, this is for you guys. All right. So for those you did put number one all you. Now let me tell you about my first good money model. So my gyms grew because I changed my attraction offer to get new customers.
(48:45) Now here's most gyms bad money model. They do a free trial into a gym membership. Here's how it works. They spend a hundred bucks to get one free trial. It takes three trials to get one $100 per month member, which means it costs $300 per paid member to get $100 a month, which means it takes three months to break even, but many members quit within four. So, here's how $100 million model fixed it.
(49:11) So, this was my $100 million gym money model, which I use something called win your money back. So, I spend the same $100 to get a customer instead of a trial. The customer spends $500 upfront with a win your money back offer, which works like this. So, you set a goal for the customer and tell them how to reach it.
(49:31) And if they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or get it back as store credit. After they win their money back as store credit, I make a special continuity bonus offer again to get them to buy again. And the result, I make way more cash flow than the bad model within 30 days.
(49:49) The cash flow let me scale to six locations in three years as a kid in my 20s. The money model worked so well I could fill new locations with paying members before they opened. I went from sleeping on the floor to six-pack locations and then eventually licensed the model out to thousands of gyms. So here's the bottom line.
(50:07) Both gyms, the free trial gym and the win your moneyback gym deliver the same service, use the same equipment, have access to the same trainers, sell the same memberships, but one makes way more. the one with the better money model. So there might not be anything wrong with your business. You might just have something wrong with your money model.
(50:26) So that was a consumer service money model with a salesman in person. This time we'll do a B2B service model with a salesman online. So let me tell you about my second $100 million money model. So if you guys sell online or over the phone or via DM or via email, I know you guys we had some twos. This is for you guys. So, Gym Launch got customers easily because my attraction offer worked.
(50:51) But getting people to buy continuity was hard. They had no reason to buy my next thing once I'd already gotten them tons of leads. So, here was my mediocre money model. I sold a $16,000 launch package. That's it. So, I spent money to get people on the phone. It took three calls to sell a new customer, but then they wouldn't buy my next continuity offer.
(51:09) So, they'd leave and I would be sad. So, every week I had to start from zero to make payroll. Very stressful. So, here's how a $100 million money model fixed it. So, on one sales call, I desperately needed to close. I unknowingly made a new offer that I now call continuity bonus offer. So, here's how it works.
(51:31) You give a customer an awesome thing for free if they join your continuity. And typically, the bonus itself has more value than the first payment. And it crushed. People started taking my continuity bonus offer. Instead of leaving, they bought something at three times the price. And my continuity started stacking and stacking. You can see the exact moment I nailed the money model here. Like look at it.
(51:54) Look at the growth curve. And that's when we went from 38,000 a month to 1.76 million a month in six months. And this is how I filled up a room like this with people paying $42,000 a year. And then a room like this 12 weeks later. 12 weeks. And then a quarter or so later, a room like this. And then a quarter or so later, a room like this. Just look at the timeline between these pictures.
(52:19) So December of 17 to March of 18 to August of 18 to February of 19. We scaled big fast at a small niche and beat our competition then sold to private equity. The main reason is this. Just look at the numbers. The difference the continuity offer made to LCV was huge. 16 versus 32,000. Insane.
(52:42) Imagine changing your offer mechanism and seeing that kind of increase without it costing you more to get customers. So the key point is this. We sold the same stuff in both, but a better money model changed the business. So once I nailed my continuity bonus mechanism, gyms bought and stuck. But they didn't have my entire money model down. So that led me to my next $100 million money model.
(53:06) So that was a B2B service business with online sales. That was my number tw's. This time we'll do a business to consumer business with number three selfch checkckout in person. So all the threes that just commented, this is for y'all. All right.
(53:24) So I had all these gyms relying on me and ad costs were going up and they needed more money to afford ads or they stopped getting customers which was the kiss of death for them and me. to cover my ad cost in my gyms. I upsold supplements and that's how I could outspend my competition. So, I figured I'd teach gyms to upsell supplements. Surprise, surprise. And I figured if I was going to do that, they might as well be mine. And Prestige Labs was born.
(53:43) So, gyms bought in, but their customers weren't buying from them. A big problem. But it was only after I taught them my four-part menu upsell mechanism, which I'll show you right now, where you unsell what they don't need, prescribe what they do need, ask if they prefer A or B, and then make it easy to pay.
(54:02) And it started working, and customers started buying. And sales went from 270,000 a month. Check this out, 270,000 a month to 1.6 million a month in two months. Eight weeks. And I'm not saying that's going to happen for you. Like your results will vary. Your results is different. This is not typical.
(54:22) But I just want to show you some of the power of getting it right. You can see the exact moment the menu upsell kicked in here. Once they had a better money model, it all clicked. So the key point is this. They sold the same product yet again. Literally the exact same tubs of protein, tubs of pre-workout, same supplements, but with a better money model. They made more money.
(54:48) And now with my menu upsell offer mechanism, gyms could afford leads again. And during COVID, having the supplement revenue line kept many lights on and households fed. We demonstrated that despite going through hard times, which co for gyms was tough, a $100 million money model could still generate strong cash flow. And that's one of the only reasons I was able to sell a gym company to private equity during COVID. Think about that.
(55:15) So, that was an in-person selfch checkout money model. This time, we'll do an online checkout money model. So, if you sell through online checkout, I saw some fours in the chat. You can drop it again. This one's for you. So, this is physical products. This is SAS.
(55:33) This is sometimes digital products, digital goods, anyone who sells out through a checkout page online. So after we' taken out distributions and gotten paid from the sale of both companies, I started making content to attract companies to ACQ and I waited for my next big money model. And that's when school came along. School's a platform that helps anyone build monetizable communities online.
(55:52) You can live stream one to many, host client calls, in-person meetups, have one-time sales, host competitions, have unlimited pricing tiers, create lifetime deals, free trials, free groups, paid groups, private groups, and process payments all in one place. But here was the money model when we started. 14 days free, then $99 a month.
(56:15) School grew with free trials, hit a million users, but it took three years. So, we made a new attraction offer. We added the school games, which had competition, rewards, and fun. Users exploded. We went from a million users to 15 million users in 18 months.
(56:38) That's 83,000 new users per month to 775,000 new users per month. That's three and a half times faster growth. Look at the difference here. And here's the best part. This new money model made us cash flow positive, which is completely unheard of for a platform at this scale growing this fast.
(56:55) And it freed up cash to invest even more into the product, making school 10 times better. Now, that takes us to present day and shows that money models work in all four ways to sell, including yours, the way you sell, and shows one of each of the attraction, upsell, downell, and continuity offer mechanisms. And normally that would be enough, but we're all here.
(57:17) So that brings me to my last $100 million money model. This book launch event itself, which is one of these, selfch checkckout online number four. A free book launch like this cost millions of dollars to put on. And letting everyone know so they can show up also cost millions of dollars.
(57:36) But instead of losing millions, I built a money model that used pre-orders, various money model mechanisms to both make this event free, right? Y'all didn't have to pay tickets to be here and have the funds to let everyone know about it. So, let me show you what we did to demonstrate the ideas of the book with the book itself.
(57:56) So, instead of just releasing a book, we offered a free event. Y'all are here. Plus, for anyone who registered, we offered VIP status if you pre-ordered. by offering more value for the same price than if you waited. Way more value, lots and lots of value. And so this is called a pay less now or pay more later mechanism.
(58:18) After that, I offer two hard copies of my ACQ handbooks for free if you bought 15 more copies, which is a buy X get Y free offer, which I use in at least seven different ways. More on that later. So here's what happened. Day one, spent $22,000, got $34,000 back. Day two, spent $26,000, got $38,000 back. Day three, spent $21,000, got $49,000 back. But here's the important part.
(58:46) On top of that, we got 13,184 folks to find out about this event for free. So, we just kept doubling down using house money to scale this all the way up. And so, the bottom line is this. We spent four plus million on advertising and got six and a half plus back. So even though this cost millions to do, I didn't need millions to do it.
(59:09) And this is the point I'm trying to emphasize here. The first day you just started with 22,000. Obviously everything's relative. All right? I'm not saying that's going to, you know, happen for you, but I'm saying that like as long as you get that first customer, you can spin the wheel, right? I just needed a $100 million money model because after that, the launch funds itself.
(59:28) So once a money model works, it's kind of like playing with house money at the casino. And this is how I scaled my gyms fast, even though I started at 22 with very little, right? This is how when I lost everything twice, I was able to get it back so fast. You just need enough to get that first customer. After that, you double down.
(59:45) You set up a $100 million money model to create the cash flow to grow, and you get out of the way. Because there's only four ways to sell stuff, and money models work in all four. And when you build a business with a $100 million money model, you can spend as much as you want to get people to find out about your stuff because you have the cash flow to do it. If you do it well, of course, it takes time and skill. My results are from both.
(1:00:03) Yours will differ. But given the size this size of this event now, you know, it works at any scale in any industry at any price. So, as long as a business sells something, there's a money model that scales it. That's how powerful it is. Yes.
(1:00:22) including your business, you who are here with me live today here on Sunday. Rock and roll. These are the skills that have been most valuable in my life. So, if you're anything like me, they are definitely skills worth learning, and I want to transfer them to you to the best of my ability. So, here's what we covered so far. Cash flow is the only thing a business needs to survive.
(1:00:42) If each customer pays for two more, you remove cash flow as a limiter. A $100 money model is a sequence of offers engineered to get each customer to pay for two more. The four money model mechanisms are attraction, upsell, downell, and continuity. There's only four ways to sell stuff.
(1:01:02) Online selfch checkckout, online with a salesperson, in person with a selfch checkckout, in person with a salesperson. And money models work for all businesses. Brick and mortar, B2B, consumer services, online businesses, SAS, and physical products. and when 100 Money Models made it made its own launch profitable using its own concepts before it was even released. Can you see how better money model getting more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again can unlock the growth you want? Can you see how having a better money model helps you grow on your own without taking on bad debts, lame investors, or
(1:01:33) terrible partners? Can you see how a stronger money model can help you weather the bad storms, bad hires, and inevitable bad economies to come? Can you see how mastering money models could change your entire business or life without changing your product or delivery? Can you see how your business, big or small, online or in person, with salespeople or without, can use 100 million money models to scale? In short, can you see why building the best money model possible is a skill worth having? And this skill may just be the bridge
(1:02:02) between where you are and wherever you want to go. At least it has been for me. So, let me ask you a question. Who here would like to master this skill? If so, drop a rocket in the chat. Great. Now, to be clear, people don't fly out to my headquarters or ask us to invest in their business because they think I understand HVAC, plumbing, insurance, lawn care, coding, hair saloning, legal, or their business in any way better than them. They come because I understand the mechanisms of making money and how to
(1:02:39) combine them in the right order. In other words, they come because I know how to build money models. So, the result of implementing these skills every day for more than 13 years, the best what I know about generating hundreds of millions a year, what took me from gym floor to doing cool stuff like this. It's with great pride that I introduce to you the $100 money model system.
(1:03:03) With this system, you have the opportunity to wield, chain, stack, and combine all 15 money model mechanisms with devastating effect. With the 100 money model system, you can learn to master monetization. You'll have access to the tools that I personally use to transform businesses like yours and mine into cash flow machines.
(1:03:24) To have the cash flow to buy yourself the time, the talent, and the advertising to scale $100 money models is the most how-to system I've ever made. And judging by the world record we just broke in the past 24 hours, possibly ever made. So, here's the first thing that you get in the 100 money model system. You convert strangers into into first-time buyers with attraction accelerator.
(1:03:42) So, if you're someone who doesn't get enough replies or optins or your web pages don't convert or people don't trust you enough to buy from your content, your leads your leads don't cost too much, then pay attention. This is for you. Remember how I scaled to six locations? I was able to do that with just one attraction offer mechanism.
(1:04:00) So, here's what they are. An attraction offer is something free or discounted that gets customers in the door, but makes money by getting them buy something better at a higher price. Here's why they matter. Without attraction offers, you're stuck competing on price or hoping people randomly find you, which keeps you struggling to grow and scrambling to find your customers.
(1:04:18) Here's why doing them right is important. Done wrong, you lose money on every customer and go out of business. Done right, customers pay you more than it costs to get them on day one, giving you unlimited growth potential. So, here's what you get inside. My five most unique and increasingly powerful attraction mechanisms.
(1:04:36) Starting with number one, win your money back. With this reverse psychology method, customers pay full price, then work like maniacs to win their money back. This backwards approach gets insane results, reviews, and referrals. Number two, giveaways. It's a 7-day formula that puts strangers into buy mode within a week, and using grand prizes the way I'll show you, floods your business with people who already want your most expensive stuff and are pre-qualified to buy it.
(1:05:00) Number three, decoys. It's a dummy offer that gets customers to ignore your cheap stuff because they like your expensive stuff even more, even though it costs way more than expected. This attraction mechanism makes expensive feel cheap and turns browsers into buyers. Number four, buy X, get Y free.
(1:05:18) A quantity multiplier that gets customers to buy way more than they planned and thank you for it. This attraction mechanism turns discount offers into irresistible free offers that get people to buy higher quantities of stuff or months of service on the spot. Number five, pay less now or pay more later.
(1:05:37) A speed bonus strategy that uses delays to get customers to pay you faster to get a better deal. This early bird strategy gets people to choose your higher value offers right now. Because the longer they wait, the more they miss out on. Now, even a single attraction offer mechanism can change your business overnight.
(1:05:56) Because when you chain stack and combine them, you get endless ways to make whatever you sell more attractive without changing what you sell. So, picture this. tomorrow, without changing anything about what you sell, you wrap your current offer in attraction in an attraction mechanism, and suddenly way more people come out of the woodwork, asking to find out more who normally ignore what you have.
(1:06:13) Now, when done right, sometimes an attraction offer is just one toe away from feeding a business for life. So, think about your current leads. Could you get more and make more money from them by nailing just one of these attraction offer mechanisms? So, here's why I was forced to learn this.
(1:06:31) The first time I started letting people know about my stuff, I didn't have a flood of interest. If anything, no one cared. It took me years to figure out how to transform something boring to exciting and turn strangers into buyers. That's what attraction offers do. But the attraction salary came at a high cost.
(1:06:49) The cost of wasting millions of stupid mistakes, enduring an endless stream of painful failures, making thousands of little tweaks that I had to figure out on my own, but above all else, cost me a decade of my life. that you'd have to go through trying to figure out how to perfect each of these mechanisms. Attraction accelerator helps you skip all that. And so the bottom line is this.
(1:07:12) A correctly installed attraction offer so valuable you could ignore everything else I show you and get more paying customers tomorrow. If you do, this will be the cheapest thing you ever invest in. And given that I charge $15,999 for licensing just one attraction mechanism to business owners.
(1:07:27) I think it's reasonable to value traction accelerator that includes not just one attraction mechanism but all five for $15,999. So that's the first thing you get. Now, if you're somebody who doesn't get leads to buy enough stuff at high enough prices or they take multiple conversations to close or delay until they never do, then pay attention. This is for you.
(1:07:47) Turn every sale into an even bigger sale with epic upsells. Here's why it matters. Attraction mechanisms get customers to make their first purchase. But if you want to maximize cash flow, you need to get them to buy more. Answer: Epic upsells. So, here's what they are. Epic upsells are whatever you offer next.
(1:08:06) Upsell maximums involve more, better, or newer versions of whatever you just bought. And they either solve a problem the earlier purchase reveals or enhance value. Here's why doing them right is important. When done wrong, people feel pressured, oversold, taken advantage of. When done right, people love them and give you cash instantly. Here's what you get inside.
(1:08:25) Epic upselles gives you my four most used mechanisms to turn first-time buyers into bigger spenders. So, the first is classic upselles. Number one, a problem reveal method where customers sell themselves on your next offer without you needing to mention it.
(1:08:44) This upsell mechanism gets customers to realize they need your next thing right after they buy your first thing. Upsell mechanism number two, menu upsells. This is what I was referencing earlier. A helpful consultant process that gets customers to realize you're not selling them stuff they don't need. Once you earn this trust, they'll takes the they'll take the next thing you offer.
(1:09:01) Usually buying way more expensive stuff faster and feeling grateful for it. This thing slays. You have to use it ethically. Number three, anchor upsells. A sticker shock strategy that gets customers to happily spend way more than they planned. And after using it myself, I find customers relieved to pay way more than they planned because your main thing looks like an incredible deal by comparison. Number four, rollover upselles.
(1:09:24) A pay it forward system that turns new customers into your highest paying repeat buyers and gets old customers more excited about your next offers. By getting customers to see a great deal right now, this upsell mechanism gets them to spend more money overall and faster. So, here's why I was forced to figure this out.
(1:09:42) So, early on, I got rejected constantly, right? Person after person told me they didn't want didn't want what I had. I got so nervous asking for sales that I would actually freeze up. And I was right to be nervous because my approach sucked and I turned people off. So instead, I figured out mechanisms that make upsells not only natural, but make it obvious the next thing's worth getting.
(1:10:00) I want to save you the hundreds of blown sales and millions in trial and error. They work without any real sales skills. Just present it. So, there's a right and a wrong way to do these, and I'll show you the best way. I sold my supplement sales system for Prestige Labs, which included just one of these mechanisms, number two, for $6,000.
(1:10:18) It helped gyms generate over $23.6 million in verified earnings. That's what they made. That's not revenue. That's what they made. Epic Upsell gives you all four, not just the one that helped generate that. All four, which is why I value it conservatively at $5,999. So given these mechanisms work for thousands of businesses, do you think you can get even one more person per month to take an upsell? Great. So here's what you get.
(1:10:53) Attraction Accelerator valued at $15,999 and Epic Upselles valued at $5,999. Total value $21,998. Now I want to talk to someone else in the audience. If you're someone who constantly hears no when you're selling, or you do payment plans and you get ghosted, or you just push too hard then sometimes regret it, or you just give out panic discounts to close the sale, or you just give up when you hear no altogether. Pay attention.
(1:11:17) This is for you. Turn every no into cash flow with dealmaker downells. So, here's why it matters. Attraction mechanisms are for getting the first purchase. Upsell mechanisms are designed to get the next one. But what if people say no? Answer: Dealmaker downells. Downell mechanisms activate when customers say no.
(1:11:42) They're usually a change in payment structure, quality, or quantity or offer different conditions. So, here's why doing them right is important. A proper downell mechanism doesn't try to get customers to say yes to something they don't want. It's about getting to say yes to something else they do. When done wrong, customers don't finish paying, they start haggling, or they don't buy and hate you.
(1:11:59) And so here's what you're going to get inside. Dealmaker downells gives you my three simplest, most used, and highest converting mechanisms to turn a no into a yes. And the best part, you can use all three to boost cash flow without any sales skills. I use them in every business I own. So here's how you use them.
(1:12:19) Anywhere someone can say no, you can and should install a downell mechanism to turn into a yes. So, the first of these, payment plan downells, which is a cash flow algorithm that steps down customers from I can't afford it to when can I start without lowering your prices. I'll show you proven payment chunking that maximizes purchases and cash flow. Plus, I'll show you my seesaw technique that makes customers choose between huge cash savings now or tiny payments later.
(1:12:41) It's sick. Down mechanism number two, trial downells. It's a skin in the game strategy that turns nos into yeses by letting customers prove to themselves that when they use your stuff as directed, it's worth paying for with a catch. The catch stops you from wasting time or money with free tire kickers.
(1:13:02) This downell mechanism gets people to use your product the right way, see real results, then pay for it. This is great for beginners. Number three, feature downell. A custom fitting formula turns nos into yeses by giving customers exactly what they want at a price they can afford. And with my locking key process, you just change qualities, quantities, or other product options to maximize what they pay for the value they get. I'll show you how to balance price versus value to get the most from every deal. And I'll give you a hint. It's not a 1:1 ratio.
(1:13:27) Here's why this exists. Dealmaker down mechanisms are cash flow maximizers you've always needed but didn't know existed in the real sales secrets you always look for but could never find. You've probably heard some or all of these. You might even tried them. But the magic isn't the concept. It's in the details.
(1:13:46) It's in the execution. And I'll show you how I've sharpened these after years of testing and combining iterations from different businesses and industries from all over the world. And this is also crazy to me because these mechanisms are huge for maximizing cash flow.
(1:14:04) Yet, no one teaches the right time to use them, how to price them, or how to structure them to turn nose into cash flow. That's the difference. Dealmaker downell methods work everywhere. Checkout pages, calls, presentations, or in person. If you sell to humans, they work. I know because I've used them in all sales formats at all scales across physical products, services, and digital businesses.
(1:14:24) So, picture this. A prospect says, "I can't afford $6,000." Instead of losing the sale, you say, "Okay, what if we did 250 a month for 24 months?" And you knew they'd pay. If they actually want your thing, they'd say, "Yeah, nob brainer." And if every week you turn one no into cash flow, it makes a difference at the end of the year.
(1:14:43) Now, let's turn the tables. Imagine someone offers you something for $6,000 and you really want it, but cash was tight this month. Then they say, "No worries. Wanted to do 24 payments at $249 and you wanted it. That would probably make it a no-brainer. So, you do it." The key is knowing when to offer it and how to make sure you get paid.
(1:15:02) Given we spent six and a half million dollars in research for school to master just one of these number two at 1 1th of that cost. This is a steal at $6,499. And given these mechanisms, do you think you can get even one more person per month to take a downell? Great. So here's what you're getting. Attraction offer accelerator $15,000. $15,999.
(1:15:28) Epic upselles val at $5,999 and dealmaker downells val at $6,499. Total value $28,497. Now this next one is for those you are living sale to sale week to week on the cash flow roller coaster and want to make consistent sales. I made this for you. Continuity blueprint, the holy grail of business. So here's what it is.
(1:15:54) a continuity mechanism that gets customers to keep making payments as long as you keep providing value. When done right, it stacks stable and predictable cash flow that grows automatically. When done wrong, it leads to rapid cancellations that burn your reputation and make make you a sitting duck in hard times.
(1:16:13) To truly maximize your cash flow, you have to stop chasing sales and build a customer base that gets bigger every month. That's the goal. But there's a problem. No one wants another monthly bill. So, here's what you're going to get inside. I'll give you my three favorite continuity mechanisms designed to get people to want to opt into continuity and to want to keep paying over time.
(1:16:32) So, continuity mechanism number one, bonus continuity. A gift wrapping strategy where you give customers something awesome, but only if they sign up today. This continuity mechanism dangles a bonus valuable enough to make customers first month feel better than free. This is how I stack recurring revenue for gym launch. And the way I do it, something I call the sliding scale.
(1:16:50) You can balance how much cash you collect up front versus how much you push into subscriptions. This is ideal for low cash flow industries. Number two, discount continuity. My free but when method that turns discounts into long-term commitments that boost cash flow. This mechanism has five sub mechanisms depending on the thing you sell.
(1:17:09) Engineered to get customers to commit for an entire year up front and stay while making them feel like they're getting a steal. And they are. Number three, wave fee continuity. A penalty avoidance mechanisms that incentivizes customers to avoid a big fee by committing long-term. Get people to choose a commitments over flexibility by making flexibility cost more.
(1:17:29) The best part is this. You get to pick the price of flexibility. It works particularly well in any business that takes time and resources to onboard customers and get customer results. I've built my fortune on continuity. gyms, supplements, software subscriptions.
(1:17:48) Breaking even, getting recurring customers is the holy grail for making companies sellable and valuable. Continuity allowed us to sell all three brands in 2021, two of which at a $46.2 million valuation. Every business wants recurring revenue, but customers don't want another subscription. These three mechanisms bridge that gap. So, learn from my mistakes. It took me 13 years of trial and error to get recurring revenue stacking month over month.
(1:18:12) The errors I made cost me millions in profits. Every day you keep making them cost you too. And the worst part with continuity, those costs compound. But here's what it looks like when it's right. You advertise and instead of losing money getting people in the door and winning months to recoup it, you break even or better. And each month you invest the cash flow of your recurring base into growth. Next month it's more.
(1:18:36) The month after that even more. That stacking is the power of continuity done right. Now for context, I sold a continuity system for gyms at $41,458 a year. And it used only one of these mechanisms. Number one inside continu continuity blueprint. You'll get all three. So it's reasonable to value this at at least the same price of $41,458. So here's what you're getting.
(1:19:03) You're getting attraction accelerator valued at $15,999. You're getting all four epic upsells valued at $5,999. You're getting the three dealmaker downells, the highest converting ones valued at $6,499. And you're getting my three most effective continuity offer mechanisms valued at $41,458. Total value $69,955.
(1:19:28) The result, you get more customers spend more money and less time over and over again, resulting in each customer paying for themselves and the next customer removing your limiter for growth, making your own $100 million money model. Once you learn, you'll chain, stack, combine, layer, and sequence every money model mechanism like a monetization engineer.
(1:19:52) Because at the core, you just do something simple. You find every problem customers have and offer to solve it for them at the right time, the right place, the right way. And you do this and you become a master of monetization. You can instantly make any product more compelling to more people and change nothing about what you deliver, just how they buy and how much they spend when they do. Correctly installing even one of these can literally change your life.
(1:20:16) You don't need anything else. Because if business feels hard, you may think the same thing that I did, that you need to change industries or switch businesses, but you really just need to change your money model. Listen, these systems are more valuable than the masterminds that sell for $25,000, $50,000, even $100,000 a year from gurus who've never even done it and will give you hilariously more value than a $100,000 four-year degree.
(1:20:41) To put this in perspective, if you paid my hourly rate for one-on-one money model strategy, it would cost you a million dollar a day. And that's not marketer math. That's what I actually that's what I did that I don't know 20 something days this year. All right. Like that's the real price. So if I priced it, it's what it's worth. $69,955.
(1:20:57) It'd be beyond reasonable for the entire system. And before I tell you the price, let me ask you a question. How much is double your lead flow worth to you? How much is double your cash flow worth to you? How much is double your growth worth to you? Really think about it. actually calculate in your head. Hold that number in.
(1:21:22) Like what is it worth to you? If you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt it would happen, which of course you can't because all business involves risk and my results aren't typical and your results will vary. But if you did, wouldn't it be worth at least that much? Because after $100 offers and $100 leads came out, I got zillions of messages of people's lives and businesses being changed.
(1:21:41) And for all these guys, it would have been worth it at any price. And that's why 100% money models is a bargain at not 69,955 but 29,997. And consider this. If all this did was allow you to start your first business like it did for me or scale your business without followers or cash or break through your multi-year plateau finally or save your business from closing like it did for me during co.
(1:22:09) If all this did was in 24 months give you the skills to launch an event, even a hundth of the size of the event we launched yesterday and today using only what's inside, wouldn't it be worth it? I think so, too. Which is why it's an even bigger bargain. And not $29,997, but $9,997.
(1:22:31) Because if every week all it does is get you one more customer at twice the value, at twice the speed, it would be more than worth it. And the best part is you only invest once, but you can monetize the skills for the rest of your life. Which is why skills are always the best investment.
(1:22:49) Look, if I had put my last thousand in the S&P 500 in 2016, which returns 9% a year, I'd have $2,400 today. But instead, I invested my last $1,000 into the SME500 skills, and turn that $1,000 into the business we have today. So, which would you rather have? $9,997 or the business you want, right? Me, too.
(1:23:16) Which is why this may be the best offer I've ever given at not $9,997, but $5,997. But because I want each of you to 2x, 5x, 10x your growth and your business over the next 12 months. And to be clear, I want that for you. But I know we guarantee it because most people do nothing. So, your results will vary. But I know how life-changing this system has been for me and my family. And I want this to be affordable for everyone, but still an investment.
(1:23:38) I'm not going to charge 6 69,955 even though be totally reasonable and a bargain. I'm not going to ask for 29,997. I'm not going to ask for 9,997. I'm not even going to ask for 5,997. And given each book demonstrates the concepts inside, it only makes sense that money models be about making money. that I charge something for the system and I feel a duty to demonstrate how to make offers properly so people don't feel bad about making exceptional products available for purchase. Which is why I'm going to give you access to
(1:24:15) everything I just talked about today in the $100 million money model system. The attraction accelerator, epic upsells, dealmaker downells, continuity blueprint that will show you how to harness all 15 money bottle mechanisms into your business for three payments of three interestf free payments of $0. Yes, it's 100% free.
(1:24:55) It's all yours as my way of saying thank you for being part of this movement. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. So on top of that, you'll also get 100% money's audiobook free. So you'll get both the money model system and the money models audio 100% free. And for those of you who are here for my promise at the beginning to get something that's better than an NFT and less than a Bitcoin, I've got something else for you here live.
(1:25:32) Did I say that I just wrote one book since last time? Well, I didn't. I wrote another book in secret. And so, it's with great pride that I'd like to present to you, The Lost Chapters. This tome contains 24 chapters that couldn't fit inside of offers, leads, and money models. This is the same quality, same finish as the other books.
(1:26:07) It's just that the chapters themselves were either too niche or there's something that only applied to too few businesses uh were too too complex. And so it includes concepts like this and this and this and a zillion more. And this will be for sale for $29.99 after this event. But for everyone here live, since you guys hopped back on today, Sunday, you can get it free, a digital copy just for being here. All right.
(1:26:38) So, you get the $100 million money model system. You get the $100 million money audio book and the lost chapters, the secret fourth book free. That's enough value, right? or is there even more? Because to not just read this stuff, but to actually use it, you're going to need the tools.
(1:27:10) So, to make sure everyone who wants to start a business can use money models. One of my investment stipulations for school was that when the time was right, which it is right now, we could do three things. Number one, add everything needed to make money models work into the platform itself, which with the features launching this month, we did. Number two, give you enough free time to get going.
(1:27:34) So instead of 14 days free, which is what school has only done for almost four plus years, we've never had another thing besides 14 days free. you with me here today for this book launch. Get not 14 days free, not 30 days free, not 45 days free, not even 60 days free, 90 days free. And number three, since inception, school's price has been $99 a month.
(1:28:03) And mind you, for many of that time, we were losing money because engineers apparently want to pay mortgages and eat food. All right, but school's price was $99 a month. But since you're here with me live today, for anyone who stays after your 90 days free, we drove down the price from $99 a month to only $9 a month for life.
(1:28:30) A lifetime low rate of $9 a month, but only for people who sign up during this book launch. So, I'm proud to say, and you can probably agree with me, that we accomplished all three. We installed the full money models tech so anyone can use it in their business. We got seven times the free time to actually get going.
(1:28:50) Make sure you can use this stuff in the real world. And then if you choose to stay afterwards, you can stay afterwards for an 11 times cheaper price. Literally, what you can pay for 11 months of school before they take you 11, you get it for 11 months of what you have to pay for one net.
(1:29:07) So, if you're an upand cominging entrepreneur, this is your free tech starter kit. This is the best head start I can give you. So, you get the money model system, the money models audiobook, the lost chapters and school, all free. Now, for everyone in the chat who is asking, where do I get it? You will get it on Tuesday morning after the launch.
(1:29:32) And so, for all of you guys who hang out afterwards, if you see somebody hops in and says, where is my where am I getting the free stuff? It's coming on Tuesday. Tuesday morning after the launch and you'll see why. Now, at the beginning, I said I was going to help two types of people today. Up andcoming entrepreneurs, I promised you I would help you get closer to that two-day for free period. And I just delivered the money model system free. Money models audio book free. The lost chapters free.
(1:29:58) 90 days of school free with an 11 times lower price afterwards for life. Do you feel like I kept my promise? Hey guys, could you take the uh the slides down real quick? So before I before I even put the first slide together, I actually thought to myself, I I wrote this out because I wanted to I wanted to say this and I tried to make it put it inside the presentation and I I couldn't fit it.
(1:30:38) And so I just want to read this to you now if that's all right. I could only keep this promise that I just made to you because I have a business and I live in a country that allows me to do business. So I could give away this stuff that costs me money for free. And I want to tell you why. Now there's a mission I have here today.
(1:31:03) I want to show the world that one of us can start from nothing and achieve anything that we put our hearts and minds to. So what do I mean by one of us? I mean the small business, the entrepreneur, entrepreneurs like you, like me, like all of us here together in this moment. We're the ones who together provide the jobs, create and innovate, and fuel the economy no matter what country we're in.
(1:31:22) But we also take the most risk. We pay the most taxes. We work the longest hours. We miss more baseball games, dance recital, family dinners, school plays than any other group in the world. And all over the world, there are entrepreneurs, one of us, who are overworked. They're stressed out. They're worried about making payroll, about paying rent.
(1:31:45) And it shouldn't be like that because you, the entrepreneur, you're the ones who, along with your fellow entrepreneurs who sit with you here today, you're the ones who make the world go round. And not a single one of us should have to experience that stress, that overwhelm, that struggle. Which is why I need your help. So sure, let's scale together, but let's do something more. To quote J.R.
(1:32:03) Tokian in the Two Towers, there's some good in this world. It's worth fighting for. As you know, our mission has always been to make real business education accessible to everyone. But there's a deeper reason behind that mission, and I want to share it with you now. I think that we can help our fellow entrepreneurs grow their business by any of a tiny fraction of a percent each.
(1:32:23) The net effect can literally change the world. And that is the impact I want us to have together. As usual, I don't have a course to sell you. I just gave you all that stuff and more for free. But I am so committed to helping our people change the world for the better that I do have an amazing gift I'd like to give you when you help me with this.
(1:32:41) So, we can all agree that the stuff inside of this book works. Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here today. And if we accept that to be true, then we also agree that the more businesses there are that have this book, the more we can help.
(1:32:59) The more we, this community of entrepreneurs, the very backbone of the world, the more we can work together to get this book into the hands of the people who need it, the more good we'll be doing for everyone. Which is why I'd like to invite you to do something big. So, before I tell you what it is to the beginners who just got all that free stuff, which will be available on Tuesday morning, are you going to complain if I incentivize the business people, the business owners to donate books to help y'all out? We good? All right. Can you pull the slides back up? All right, then.
(1:33:33) Let's rock and roll. 100 million men assemble. Let me take this. There we go. All right. So now, business owners, players, money makers, if you're in the game, I made this for you. I said I'd show you how it's in your best interest to help me help everyone else and how we can accomplish both our goals together.
(1:34:04) So, I'm going to ask you to donate 200 books. That's $5,998 in book donations. Then I'm going to spend the next few minutes explaining why donating 200 books be the best business decision that you make this year easily because two years ago I'd already written the money model's book.
(1:34:29) That's a picture of me at the last launch with the book title covered up that I revealed at the end. Two years ago I'd already recorded the money model's audio. I'd already assembled the money model system, the whole thing. And then I asked myself, if I wanted business owners to help me get these books in the hands of every entrepreneur in America, that's 32 and a half million people, what would be the most valuable thing I could do to incentivize business owners to have them help me make it happen? So, this was my answer, working one-on-one with you to help implement everything I know into your specific business today.
(1:35:00) So, I did something unorthodox. Only weeks after my last book launch, I started inviting business owners business owners out to my headquarters for small private in-person workshops. And hearing that, you might be thinking for a guy with an international 13 million plus person audience offering small private in-person workshops using his actual portfolio might be the dumbest lesal model imaginable.
(1:35:23) And you'd be right if you didn't know why I did it. You see, I started these workshops weeks after the last launch to prepare for this one. Over the last 18 months, we met in person with 1,26 plus small businesses across all these industries. A lot across all these revenue brackets, also a lot. And I didn't do all these meetings, all these workshops, all these consultations because I thought they were scalable.
(1:35:47) They're not. I did it all for this moment. To get one thing, data. I wanted to know once and for all the problems you're dealing with right now. What's limiting your growth today? Your bottlenecks at this moment. Everything is keeping you up at night. Everything is holding you back. Everything is keeping you stuck.
(1:36:06) And after meeting with 1,26 plus businesses in person, in real life, we codified everything. And every business's growth was constrained by one of four things. Leads, you can't get enough qualified prospects. Sales, you can't convert the prospects you got into customers. Delivery, you can't retain the customers you got long enough.
(1:36:24) Or pro number four, you're doing the first three, but your bank account just doesn't show it. So you develop complete systems to fully solve every constraint. Four systems in total. The leads constraint we solve with the lead system. The sales constraint we solve with the sales system. The delivery constraint we solve with the delivery system. And the profit constraint we solve with the profit system. No small task.
(1:36:44) But here's what makes these systems different from anything else out there. These aren't theories. They're tested solutions. Each developed by working with 1,26 plus real businesses in real life. Every system contains the exact processes, scripts, and literal checklist we give to our $35,000 plus advisory clients to break through their biggest constraints.
(1:37:05) These aren't digital downloads or PDFs, and they never will be. They're just too valuable. They're not some login that you'll never use or some file you'll scroll through once and then forget. This had to be a physical implementation system. So you're getting something that you can hold, reference and display on your shelf and implement from something with hard value and real cost. All bound together, organized by system in one premium binder.
(1:37:46) Now each system contains its own set of playbooks. You guys want to know what's inside? I will show you. All right, let's get this nice and prettied up for you guys. You have something good to look at. There we go. All right, so for the lead system, there are four playbooks. For the sales system, we have three playbooks.
(1:38:27) For the delivery system, you have two playbooks. And for the profit system, you have three playbooks. to solve all codified constraints. And given 1,26 plus businesses paid $35,000 for part of just one of these playbooks that unlocks their specific business constraint. All 12 is $420,000 of actual true we actually charged for it value.
(1:39:11) And today, right now, I want to put all 12 playbooks in your hands when you help me put 200 books in the hands of the entrepreneurs who need them. I told you I was going to incentivize the business owners to put these books in more people's hands. And so, I'm going to deliver on that. That's $5,998 in book donations. And you're going to want to get them right now at go.acq.com.
(1:39:37) Now, I've got good news and I've got bad news. The good news is I secured a partnership through a firm to make it affordable to anyone who wants to donate. So, even more of you want to get playbooks can. All right? And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate books to get everything in your hands for as little as $249 a month interest free.
(1:39:57) And if you aren't seeing a firm at the checkout at goq.com, you can hit the the little little dots at the top and check out as guest. You can also hit check out as guest at the bottom and you'll see a firm at the bottom of the page right there in that little box. All right. Anyways, so $249 a month comes out to donating two books a week. That's it.
(1:40:16) And I made donating super easy by hiring and training 300 phone reps to help anyone who's issue checking out for real. It was insane. And so you'll see their number on any failed checkout. Just call and they will help you. All right.
(1:40:35) Now, on top of that, when you support other entrepreneurs by donating books, you won't have to wait until Tuesday to access the free stuff. You'll get access to everything right now. Now, for the bad news, I only assembled 25,000 of these implementation systems. And it's likely we'll sell the 25,000. Just to put this in perspective, I don't know how many how many how many we got live right now.
(1:41:02) Well, I don't know how many we got live, but I also plan on emailing my list of 1.4 million people uh with this offer. And we also have 21,990 affiliates who actively are sending emails right now. And to be clear, that's not 21,990 people. That's 21,990 audiences. A mountain of people, which is already way more than the number of systems I assembled. All right? And with 3 million plus people, we less than 1% of businesses to donate.
(1:41:28) But historically, less than 1% is fairly low for a book launch like this. For context, around 2% is a normal lead conversion rate for a live launch. To give you an example, my last launch converted at 12.2%. We had 56,000 out of 460,000. Now, this is a different offer, but also way more people, but we also have really good financing.
(1:41:49) So, I think it's reasonable that would be about 3 to 5% warm conversion, which would quickly move the 25,000. And if you're wondering why I did this, it's for two reasons. Number one, scarcity changes behavior. And I wanted to give this to business owners who cared the who cared the most, a good reason to act the fastest in the best ways I know how, so I can get more books in the hands of entrepreneurs who need them.
(1:42:13) And two, I just didn't order enough. So, if you want to guarantee yours, you can grab them now at go.acq.com because it's mathematically probable that we will sell the 25,000. Right now, we're already over half and uh I won't tell the exact end date, but typically uh sales in these types of situations are uh half on the front and half on the end when it closes.
(1:42:40) We are already past the halfway point, which means that there's very likely that at the end there will be people who will not be able to get it. So, if you want it, do it now. And the donation deal, which you will soon see, will only get better. And for the ultra business owners who always ask, "Is there anything more if we donate even more for the first time ever?" The answer is yes. And you will like it. It's the number one request I've had from business owners for four years.
(1:43:00) It's a one-time thing I'm doing only for this launch. All right? It includes access to me for six months on some serious goodies that you would only appreciate as a serious business owner if you donate even more books. But you got to grab the 200 books to see that. and you'll see that ultra business owner bonus on the 200 purchase confirmation page. All right.
(1:43:17) Anyways, quick logistics. So, the 200 books you donate get sent to entrepreneurs who need them. You don't have to worry about physically storing or shipping the donated books. If you want any copies for yourself, you'll get a code. You can use as many as you want up to 199. Just pay the shipping and handling. And the code is good for a year. So, any books that you don't use or give away, we will.
(1:43:35) That was the number one request from last year. And yes, this entire donation is a 100% dollar for-doll tax deduction for businesses. Now, to use affirm, just a reminder, just hit check out as guest and it's the thing at the bottom.
(1:43:54) Now, for all my international folks, we're live in 50 plus countries, which is absolutely insane. Last year, I think we only got up in eight. Like, kudos to the team for working so much overtime to get taxes and and all these other things approved so we could actually ship to you. All right.
(1:44:07) Now that being said, we had the choice of either not shipping or accepting the fact that it costs money to ship books which are heavy and crossing oceans. We chose to give you the chance if you chose to to choose to pay the extra shipping. It doesn't come to us. All right? So, please reserve all of the the negative shipping vibes, which I agree with you on, and blame your governments, blame physics.
(1:44:24) All right? So, while you check out, here's what you're getting when you donate 200 books to entrepreneurs who need them. The first thing that you're going to get is the leads implementation system. So, these playbooks right here give you the tools to unlock unlimited leads yourself, like how to scale ads with Goded ads playbook, how to write hooks that sell, not just get views with the hooks playbook. How to build a reputation that gets the right people to buy with the branding playbook. And how to build the operational flows to remove
(1:44:56) yourself from marketing entirely with the marketing machine playbook. So let's start with the first. The first is the go to ads playbook. You ever hit a ceiling with your ad spend? Your CPAs, your cat goes crazy. You can't scale past a certain point. This playbook gives you the exact process we follow to break through ad ceilings and keep scaling. So here's just a fraction of what's inside.
(1:45:21) The ad assembly process, which shows how to turn five ads into 600 ads a month using hook, meet CTA. our ads scaling strategy which shows how to target every customer segment from completely unaware to most aware. This how you actually scale creative and hooks to break into new customer segments and the 702010 framework so you can juice winning campaigns way longer and duplicate them more easily.
(1:45:47) That's the first of the four leads implementation system playbooks. The second is the hooks playbook. If you create any content, ads, social media, emails, literally anything, this contains the 8020 of hookw writing from 35,000 pieces of content. I didn't wake up with viral video like some people do. I had to I had to will my way into building an audience. And I did not have the talent to do it when I started.
(1:46:08) And so, here's just a fraction of what I'll show you inside. Proven formulas that work across all content types. The best performing hooks across all platforms, email, social, ads, everything. and simple checklist to create winning hooks every time. So that's the second playbook that you're going to get inside of the leads implementation system.
(1:46:28) That's for people whose content isn't turning into sales and they need to do better. The third is the brand playbook. So some of you guys might have noticed that direct response isn't working like it's used to. Used to be able to just run an ad up and start making money. Doesn't work that way anymore.
(1:46:45) This shows you how to build a premium brand that commands way higher prices and gets cheaper leads who buy more often. Cracking this enabled me to break through my $30 million per year revenue ceiling that I was stuck at for over three years. So, here's just a preview of what's inside. The exact topics and associations to pick and build the brand that gets you the customers and sales you want. The brand flywheel.
(1:47:03) How to reinforce, broaden, narrow, scale, or pivot a brand. The perfect positioning process to turn views into sales instead of just vanity metrics. That's the third playbook that you're going to get inside of the leads implementation system. The fourth is the marketing machine. So, let's be honest, making ads and content can be tiring. This is how you remove yourself as the face of your marketing.
(1:47:25) It took me 18 plus months to remove my face completely from gym launch while growing sales. And so, here's just a fraction of what's inside. Nine perpetual ad flows that generate fresh marketing content weekly. These are so sexy. It's hard to describe these besides saying like you don't change anything about what you do.
(1:47:43) You install these processes and all of a sudden every week you get an inbox full of new ads that you didn't have to edit or create. It's the best thing I can describe it as. On top of that, you have a onetime setup that captures testimonials and ads from everything you already do and the complete system to exit your face from marketing without losing sales. Without this, I would have never been able to sell Gym Launch.
(1:48:03) So, that's the fourth playbook that you get in the leads implementation system. So, here's some proof this actually works. So, this is what we spent advertising this event to get you here up to 500,000 a day. And you can't reach this scale without systems that scale with you. That's just Meta and Google on the 13th.
(1:48:21) So, that was uh Thursday, I think. All right. Like really, like you can't scale spend like that unless you have systems that scale with you. And the result of that was 584,000 registrations and selling more books before this launch than we sold at the last launch. Using these playbooks and checklists, I grew from zero to 13 million plus people across all platforms in five years.
(1:48:45) And again, I didn't have the talent, right? I like I had to work at this and I had to figure out how to actually do this. And I documented these checklists here so other businesses can follow. And so using the tactics contained specifically just in the marketing machine playbook is how we created 1,452 ads for this launch. And that was just for our first round of ads.
(1:49:06) So to give you a little proof of this, this was actually a warning we got from Facebook because we had actually maxed out Facebook's ability to handle ads. You can see the near ad limit for page. And you can only get to that limit by having a machine that can help you operationalize it.
(1:49:23) And listen, these taxes don't just work for me, right? Chris How, he's a commercial architect, was able to scale his deal pipeline from just a few deals a month to tripling his business. And using these principles, Jorge was able to scale his his ads and lead flow for his local pharmacy. He said, "After launching the strategy your team gave us, business exploded, traffic surged by over 30%. We had to grow the team just to keep up for the first month.
(1:49:39) " And this is Ava, who's 19 years old, who was able to take her content agency from 10 to 15 new deals a month to 40 to 60 new deals a month. And these were B2B high ticket recurring sales. So that's your leads implementation system. four playbooks that solve the biggest leads constraints we found in 1,026 plus businesses.
(1:49:59) So, when you donate 200 plus books, you're going to get the go to ads playbook, you're going to get the hooks playbook, you're going to get the branding playbook, and you're going to get the marketing machine playbook. All free when you donate 200 bucks. But wait, there's more. And if you want to pick those up, you can go to go.hq.com.
(1:50:20) The next is the sales implementation system. These guys, whether you can't get leads to show, can't close them when they do, or it's taking forever to get a yes, these playbooks show what we've done to solve these problems for good. So, the first is the lead nurture playbook. So, at Allen, we analyzed every variable that increases shows across 100,000 plus appointments.
(1:50:39) The findings in this playbook contain the most data driven show system that I'm aware of. And so, here's just a fraction of what you'll get inside. The four pillars of lead nurture. These are the tactics to maximize speed, volume, personalization, and medium to get more schedules. Then the 16 actions we take to turn schedules into shows and achieve 89% show rates. They take no skill.
(1:51:01) That's one of the beauties of this. This is so operational. You just check the list. Doesn't matter who it is. You can just follow the checklist. And so what's crazy about this is that most entrepreneurs waste a lot of time trying to take their close rates from 22% to 23% when they've got a double sitting on their show rates if they just follow the process.
(1:51:23) And that translates directly to sales the same exact way and takes way less skill. Again, it's not a promise that's going to happen for you. I'm saying I'm illustrating how this works. And so that's the first playbook that you get inside of the sales implementation system. The second is the closing playbook. So, when I was living mo in motel and $100,000 in debt, my sales team couldn't close.
(1:51:42) And so, this playbook contains the exact closes that I drilled them on to save my business. So, here's just a preview of what's inside. This is so sexy and I have never talked about this publicly and I've been waiting for this launch to do this. The seven universal closes. They work no matter what a prospect says. They're the first seven that every salesman must memorize.
(1:52:07) And I've never seen these identified ever. There's like you could learn nothing else. Next, you get the reframe framework, which turns every question into a buying statement and gets avoiders to decide while real nos reveal their true concerns. And the urgency creation system, the words to say that make prospects buy now instead of thinking about it even when you have no deadline.
(1:52:29) So that's the second playbook that you're going to get. Here we go. The third playbook is the proof playbook. So sales take too long because you don't have enough of the right kinds of proof at the right times. This playbook solves that. So here's just a fraction of its contents. The belief continuum.
(1:52:49) How to move prospects along from considering to buying. The system I use to capture volume of proof so testimonials happen automatically and overwhelm competitors. So think proof over promise. It works in person and online. And you get the 13point proof checklist that instantly diagnoses why your ads, emails, and calls aren't converting. So, here's proof this works.
(1:53:13) These are my actual show rates for ACQ this last year using the lead nurture playbook. 89%. You can just read you look at them. And these are actual close rates from the last year using the closing playbook. 46%. Not bad. And I used 213 examples approved during this presentation following the 13-point proof checklist.
(1:53:42) And to prove this works for any business, not just ours, we actually used all three playbooks from the sales implementation system. Working with a portfolio company IBC global, which is insurance. So here's a direct quote from the founder, Steve. We went from 20% to 61% conversion of all appointments. 3xed our total appointments converted using the ACQ nurture closing and proof process numbers are up and to the right big time. Think about the difference there.
(1:54:09) If you could if you went from converting 20% of appointments to 61% of appointments, insane. We distilled down everything of what we did here. Not promising it's going to happen for you. I'm just saying, can you imagine what a difference that would make for a business? And here's another portfolio company that we used all three playbooks in. So this is Stacy. She said, "This year, well operations took their close rates from 27% to 45%.
(1:54:31) A massive difference to the business just following the process." So that's your sales implementation system. Three playbooks that solve the biggest sales related constraint we found in 126 plus businesses. So here's what you get when you donate 200 bucks. All right. So right off the bat, you're getting 200 bucks real value.
(1:54:50) On top of that, you're getting the lead system, which includes goated ads, hooks, branding, and marketing. And I'm going to highlight branding right now. Right now, if you're in a business that you are suffering because people compare you to other people, you don't have enough inbound demand, people want to haggle with your prices, they bulk, they say, I'll think about, I'm not sure. Brand is the way that you can command higher prices and get cheaper leads. It does both.
(1:55:13) It also increases repurchase rates. It's the, you know, one hit KO of business. It just takes time to do, but it can take way less time to do if you do it right. You get all four playbooks for free with the lead system when you donate 200 bucks. On top of that, you're getting the lead nurture, closing, and proof checklist, which is the sales system absolutely free when you donate 200 bucks. You can go to go.acq.com. But we're not done yet.
(1:55:37) So, next up, you get the delivery wrong playbooks. Here we go. The delivery implementation system. This solves the two biggest constraints that kill profitability. Customers not paying enough and customers not staying long enough. So the first is the lifetime value playbook.
(1:55:57) So if leads cost too much, it's common that they don't really cost too much, but you make too little. The customer value multiplication framework helps solve this. So here's just a fraction of what's inside. The eight ways customers can transact with your business. You leverage all eight and never worry about rising CAC again. And what's crazy is that most businesses only use one or two.
(1:56:17) Next, nine real actual in the world actually work cost cutting frameworks that drop every save dollar straight to your bottom line and the customer value map which shows you how to maximize revenue per customer interaction ethically. So that's the first of the playbooks that you'll get inside of the delivery system. So let's make this nice and pretty. There we go.
(1:56:44) So that's the first of the two that you'll get. The second is the retention playbook. So I've been in the recurring revenue business my entire life. Understanding churn has been a scientific process for me. Like show rates is not one thing. It's a hundred small things and you got to do them all. The good news, the hard part is figuring out what they are.
(1:57:04) The easy part is doing them. So here's a preview of what's inside. real retention data from millions of memberships showing how to reverse engineer churn from engagement activation. Remember, I own school. We have literally millions of memberships. We have tremendous amounts of data to figure out what actually causes people to stick.
(1:57:24) And you have the updated five horse and retention for service-based businesses. And the complete n-step turn elimination protocol with activation points and onboarding frameworks. Now, here's some proof this actually works. So, we used these two together and we widen a portfolio company of ours and doubled how much customers were worth and how fast they paid with the extra cash dropping straight to the bottom line, which 7 and a halfxed profit per location.
(1:57:55) I'm going to say that again. Doubled LTV, which 7 and a halfx profit per location across all 17 stores in two years. without changing anything about their core services just using the implementation within these two playbooks for the delivery system. Now to give you another example, here's our month 12 retention on school.
(1:58:27) This retention curve is how we have 15 million plus users on school which means that we retain so well that we net more than one user per user which makes school grow even faster. And so here's proof that this works not just for my business but any business.
(1:58:45) So this is Eric and Amanda A who own a digital art marketplace. They said AOV more than doubled. Result: better customers should pay faster, pay more. Thank us for it. We've maintained revenue, improved margins and we can breathe. So here's another. This is what Paul Law, founder of Multiverse Beans, had to say. I attribute a lot of what of the growth to what you said to me at the workshop.
(1:59:01) Customer journey is what matters most. Overall, 66% growth for seven and a half months. So, that's your delivery implementation system. Two playbooks to solve the biggest delivery related constraints that we found in 1,026 plus businesses. So, here's what you're getting when you donate 200 bucks.
(1:59:21) So, you're getting 200 bucks, $5,998 of True Value, and you're getting all four playbooks in the lead system for free. You're getting all three playbooks in the sales implementation free and you're getting delivery system free when you go to go.hqq.com. But next up, you get the profit implementation system. And oh, this is sexy. This is the last constraint that kills businesses.
(1:59:47) You work all day every day just for the small percentage of cash left over at the end of the month. With a few tweaks, that number can be much bigger. These playbook contain the three lowest operational effort systems you can implement into a business to improve its cash position. So the first is the fast cash playbook. How to inject cash into a business using only what you've already got.
(2:00:07) Every business needs a way to generate cash quickly. Taxes, emergencies, extra payroll months, funding expansion, or my personal favorite, to just give yourself a raise. And so here's a fraction of what's inside. Ready to send 7-day countdown email and text promotion sequences tested on thousands of businesses. We already know work because we've already used them.
(2:00:26) Quarterly cash system with 90-day rotation. So, you can set these and run them on a cadence. As soon as I figured out that running one of these was good, I was like, how could I do this on a regular cadence? Well, I can't do it every week. So, then I had to create a calendar around this because the sales you can make from this drop disproportionately to the bottom line. Like, I cannot emphasize this enough.
(2:00:43) I'll tell you a story about this later. The third thing you'll get is the fast cash checklist to help you pick, assemble your list, pick your offer, price it, and send it all within the fast cash checklist. So, that's the first of the three profit implementation playbooks. The second is the pricing playbook.
(2:01:02) This contains my top 10 mostus instant pricing based profit optimizations. These are the first strategies I would use to cover this donation. So, here's a preview of what's inside. 10 instant pricing optimizations. So, let me give you an example. If you go from monthly billing to 28 day cycles every four weeks, that gives you 8.
(2:01:27) 3% more revenue, which means 13 billing cycles instead of 12, but it typically never changes sales closing percentages. So, you can have instant 8.3% increase. That drops disproportionately to the bottom line. That is just one of 10 different pricing optimizations that I've learned over the years that are contained inside of the pricing playbook. On top of that, there's 17 pricing algorithms. They explain if this then that.
(2:01:45) So if at full capacity and you need help, do X. If at full capacity and you don't, do Y. And so if you were to implement all of these, assuming you had none and no fewer sales, it would represent one of the most significant profit increases that you could do in a business without changing anything about what you sell or how you advertise.
(2:02:03) So that's the pricing playbook. So the third is the price raise playbook. So if you raise prices or change prices, right, you make more profit doing the same or less work, which is great. This is the highest leverage thing that you can send tomorrow. So here's just a fraction of what you'll get inside. So how to find your pricing sweet spot without losing customers or needing fancy analytics.
(2:02:27) The raised price method with trap doors to keep select customers without playing favorites. And the price raise letter tested by hundreds of businesses. Just fill in the blanks and send. This thing is gold. It's amazing. Like it is if you're gonna if you're going to change prices, then the biggest risk you could do is having people leave.
(2:02:48) But if you can change prices and minimize that and actually get more people to come back and make more from it, it's one of the most profitable things you can do. This has been sent from hundreds of businesses and we have just tweaked and tweaked and tweaked and tweaked this letter and it is just amazing.
(2:03:05) So that's the third playbook that you get inside of the profit implementation system. So, here's proof this actually works. So, part of how Jim Launch sold $15,999 packages in a market with a $32,000 immediate income was fast cash plays. So, we gave them the skills to make the money to afford the help they needed. So, if you sell B2B, having this and plays like this in your back pocket to help your customers afford your services is awesome.
(2:03:34) On the flip side, if you're the type of business that sells B TOC or business to consumer, then you should just use the plays yourself instead of needing somebody else to give them to you. Now, the result of these pricing levers when used together from the pricing playbook were Jim Launch's actual gross margins. Pretty impressive. So, here's proof this works not just for my business, but any business. So, here's what Corey, who owns ProShine HVAC Duck Cleaner, said. He said, "These principles were super easy to implement in my business.
(2:03:59) Almost like finding $100 bills everywhere I went. After sitting out with my business, I'm fairly confident to say this brought 15 to 20% back to my business just sitting there." I mean, if you had a 15 to 20% change in your business without really doing anything, just changing how you position the prices, wouldn't that be material? I'm not saying that's going to happen for you, but like think about the math there. Huge.
(2:04:16) And here's what Tusaintain, who owns a marketing agency uh that sells a stem cell clinic, said. He said, "The pricing playbook, this puppy alone paid for my VA workshop. Before using it, I had a lot of friction in increasing LTV for my clients due to selling a high ticket offer.
(2:04:35) I read the book on the flight home, implemented Alex's tactics, and not only did triple LTV, we also tripled the amount of clients we were signing, all due to the positioning tactics in the playbook. So, I don't know about you, but triple LTV, triple the number of people signing up. Good. And so, here's more proof that the pricing playbook works.
(2:04:54) So, James Patrick, health consultant, he said, "If you guys are looking for feedback on $100 pricing, this [ __ ] is gold. An easy read on an hour flight. Have clarity on how to make XYZ." Frank Larosa, Elite Recruiting. Uh, you can tell Alex's price book is one of the best books ever read in terms of having immediate impact when I roll these ideas out ASAP.
(2:05:07) Roof Leopard, we get nosed due to our pricing and are closing at 42% close rate this season while increasing our average ticket from last year by $5,500. Just from that, increasing the average ticket by $5,500. For him, that would have covered the entire donation. I'm saying not saying that'll happen for you. I'm saying but for him that would have just from one sale.
(2:05:33) Now these are the businesses that use the pri uh the proven price raise playbook because this is one of the scariest things that you can send to your clients but also one of the most profitable. So here's Danielle. We took our price from $115 to 196 every four weeks. We were super scared to send the letter but ended up being the single best decision we ever made as a business. Here's Stephen rolled out a price increase letter to 32 clients.
(2:05:51) Honestly wasn't sure it would land. raising memberships by an extra 22 $226 a month. Ended up being the single fastest revenue deliver I've ever pulled in my business ever. Stephanie, I took my price from 200 to four, you know, 396 and 516 a month. Best decision we've made for our business. We've now looked back since.
(2:06:09) Leander, I implement a 78% membership rate increased across 700 subscriptions. It was a bold move, but I allowed me to significantly boost revenue, reinvest uh in the experience, and elevate the perceived value of the brand. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've made for long-term growth. So, that is your proven profit implementation system.
(2:06:27) These three playbooks solve the biggest profit related constraints that we found in 126 plus businesses. Plenty of businesses got everything going right. They're just charging too little. And actually walking through the process to raise your prices. Like, I'm going to give you a little math example.
(2:06:44) If you were running 20% margins and you add 20% to your prices and you have basically no change in your sales, which often happens, sometimes it goes up. You don't add 20% to your profit, you double your profit. That's how powerful pricing is. And so, here's what you get in the $100 money models system. Let me put this nice and pretty for you guys. There we go. Okay. There. Nice and pretty. Put this here. Boom. Okay.
(2:07:17) So, when you donate 200 bucks, a real value of $5,998, you're going to get the lead system, which includes goated ads, hooks, branding, and uh marketing machine. So, if you're if you're having trouble scaling ads, like we know how to scale ads. We spend hundreds of thousands a day across multiple companies, right? Like there's a process to doing it.
(2:07:34) And if you're stuck, it could be the biggest thing to get you to the next level. So, you get all four leads simplation systems free. The second thing is you get the sales system. So, if you're struggling to convert prospects, they're taking too long, they're getting too many nos.
(2:07:47) We have nurture to get more schedules, get them more shows, you can close a higher percentage of them, and with proof checklist, you close them faster. You get all three of those free. On top of that, you have the delivery system, which includes lifetime value and retention.
(2:08:00) So, how can we transact with customers in more ways so we can uh provide more value and extract more value? Basically, do more exchanges of business. And how do we get them to keep staying? And with school, we have millions of memberships. I feel like we are we can be some of the foremost experts in how do you actually retain customers? All right. Everything we've learned from millions and millions of dollars to spend is inside of this playbook and it's yours for free.
(2:08:17) Now, the fourth system that you get for free is the profit system. All right. So, this includes fast cash playbook, things that you can immediately send tomorrow within your business immediately. The pricing playbook that contst instant pricing optimizations like if I had to swap places with you tomorrow and be like, I have to find a way to cover the donation.
(2:08:35) Those the first things I'd open and start using. And then finally, got the price race playbook. Price it, send it, and we know, we'll walk you through the exact process on how to make sure people don't get upset, how to position it, how to handle groups if you have that for your customers, how to script out a video so you can say it the right way, make it look classy, the whole thing. Get all four for free.
(2:08:53) Solving the real constraints of 1,26 plus businesses like yours. This took two plus years to figure out all the problems and then document and test each one of the solutions so we can put them in these playbooks so that we can hand them out to businesses being like, "Oh, you have a show rate issue. Solve it with this.
(2:09:11) Oh, you have a churn issue. Solve it with this. Oh, you have a pricing issue. Solve it with this. Oh, you know what? We should increase LTV. Solve it with this. This is in theory. There's solutions we charge 35,000 for. Plus, to be clear, I'm going be upfront about this. People also got one day in person with us. All right? That's also why this is 6,000, not 35,000. But they got one, not all 12.
(2:09:30) So, think of these as your treasure map to scaling from wherever you are to where you want to go. So today you get all 12 playbooks for free when you donate 200 books to entrepreneurs who need them. And if you want all 12 implementation playbooks, just go to go.acq.com right now. All right, it's the link at the bottom.
(2:09:48) And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate to get everything in your hands for as little as $249 a month interest free. And if you aren't seeing a firm, just hit the top right, hit check out as guest. Uh there's also one at the bottom there. And uh you will see the payment option for a firm at the bottom of the page near the pay now button. All right. So, you have to select it in order to see it.
(2:10:05) So, if you have trouble checking out, we do have a phone number that will appear for you to call to get support. So, call them. We got 300 plus people who have been trained uh to help you guys out. All right. Now, while you're checking out, let me make sure let me show you how we're going to make sure that you implement the right solution the right time for you.
(2:10:23) So, imagine you're about to begin your quest, right? But what happens when you hit a roadblock specific to your exact business situation? Most people get stuck and give up. Now, I couldn't personally consult with everyone, but I had an idea that changed everything.
(2:10:40) So, I told you earlier that we met with 1,026 plus businesses who paid over $35,000 each. That's $35 million in advisory work. But the one thing I left out is I also personally met with 226 plus businesses that paid $135,000 or more each for me to oneonone break down their business. Now look at this behemoth. I compiled all my notes.
(2:11:17) These are my actual notes for meeting with 226 businesses that I worked with. And so if I spaced out working with all these businesses with no weekends, it would be one business every other day, end to end for two years. And these are just some of the pictures of the meetings that I actually did over the last two years to put this together for you. A truly backbreaking amount of work.
(2:11:39) And I definitely didn't do it because oneonone consulting in person scales, but because the biggest issue I continue to have is people asking, "Alex, what should I do to grow my business?" And I really want to answer that question for you. I mean that. But there's only so many hours in the day and I still have my main job at ACQ.
(2:11:58) And so I personally documented the exact problems and solutions for 226 plus businesses. I did this monstrous amount of work that cannot scale for a very particular reason to build something that can. So here's what I did. For every business I met with, we had intake calls. We took down their stats, their industry, took extensive notes, did a constraint analysis. I personally delivered the recommendations in person.
(2:12:20) I documented their exact problems and solution, exactly what they would act on and in what order, and organized followup to give them their next steps. Now, to all the 135,000 folks who are watching this, don't worry. All your data is protected. All right? So, it's safe. No one's going to like see your stuff.
(2:12:37) But again, I personally consulted with every business, recorded every insight call, every constraint analysis, every recommendation, every follow-up call, all my actual notes. I recorded all of it, all in preparation for this very moment. Violent, obscene, ruthless, wise. I trained a custom AI on everything. ACQ AI, my endto-end analysis of each of the 226 plus businesses that paid $135,000 each.
(2:13:18) Every constraint, every solution, every implementation step, plus all three books, $100 million offers, $100 leads, $100 money models, and the notes that aren't published that made those books, all trained in ACQAI. Then I trained the AI on all 12 implementation playbooks that you just got.
(2:13:35) the leads implementation playbooks, the sales impotmentation playbooks, the delivery implementation playbooks, the profit implementation playbooks, and I plugged into this AI so it could have consistent inputs and outputs. Now, I work with a lot of businesses. There's a lot of businesses here, but let me just tell you a couple of them.
(2:13:52) I worked with pest control, carpet cleaning, restaurants, waste management, logistics, cannabis, lighting, legal, accounting, wealth, financial advisors, tax marketing agencies, content creators, influencers, media companies, spoofing, construction, remodelers, real estate brokerage, uh, lenders, real estate agents, real estate investors, fund managers, crypto funds, web design, IT services, content ads, branding agencies, design shops, online coaches, gyms, nail salons, hair salons, massage therapy, med spas, auto repair, coaching, courses, community owners, online business, e-commerce, car dealerships, blogging, franchisers, meal
(2:14:15) prep, e-commerce brands, virtual assistant agencies, recruiters, insurance, physical therapy, B2B SAS, B TOC, B2B services, B TOC SAS, B TOC services, cash practice, general practitioners, dentist, surgeons, urgent carees, pharmacies, HVAC, plumbing, lungare, residential, commercial cleaning.
(2:14:33) So, if you're wondering, but will it be able to help with my specific business? Yes, for three reasons. First, I helped 226. That was 60 of them. I did four times more than that. Second, because I probably helped a business exactly like yours, not once, but multiple times, some bigger, some smaller. Third, even if I hadn't worked with a business exactly like yours, you should want insights from outside of your industry. That is how you get ahead.
(2:15:08) As the result is that you get answers in minutes that would otherwise take years of trial and error to discover on your own. And the best part, you'll never have to wonder, "Hey, Alex, what should I do with my business again?" So, if the playbooks are your map, then HQAI is your vehicle. It's getting there.
(2:15:27) This is the first time this data has ever been made available to anyone, and at no small cost. And if this sounds absurdly valuable, it's because it is. Normally, a fraction of this intelligence or work would cost $135,000 per consultation. It's literally the most valuable thing I can give you. And here's business owners who just got in yesterday who started using it inside of this is the ultra business owners group by the way. Um so that has anyone used it yet? He said I played with it all last night.
(2:15:53) I've been using AI for business coaching for the last couple years. Tried them all but this thing has been so much more direct and decisive. I love how it references places in the books to read instantly. Yes, loving this thing so far. I've been back and forth with it answers plugging them into knowledge base.
(2:16:06) I've already uh things are already getting dialed nicely. Shaina, I was shocked at the specific details asked for and how quickly it gave me detailed game plan, not wishy-washy at all. In true Alex fashion, this is what you need to do. Full stop. Shaina, 100%. I was starting to feel that all common AI models were leaning towards telling us we wanted to hear, so we use it more.
(2:16:24) This AI from Alex is completely different in that regard. It tells you what to do and doesn't cater to your feelings at all. Sorry, I tried to make it nicer, but I guess it's it's learned too much from me. Um, which I need right now. And Stephanie, I found the same. It was also super specific to my business. I didn't have to give it as much context.
(2:16:41) It asked the right questions. This is real people using this now. So, why would I give such an unstoppable machine away? Well, let's not pretend I'm just giving this away because I'm not. There is a catch. But before I tell you, books, experiences, and tutors changed my life more than anything.
(2:17:07) which is why I want to get these books into the hands of every entrepreneur in America and eventually the world. And if you're already donating 200 books and see how this AI tool is more valuable than any one-off consulting that people even pay $135,000 for and will give you hilariously more value than hiring another mid-level employee or a vendor with a fraction of the experience and is way faster than trying to figure out everything for yourself through years of trial and error.
(2:17:31) And again, to put this in perspective, not even counting the fact that this AI is shown on all three of my books and the notes that are unwritten that you haven't seen, all 12 of the implementation playbooks, the leads playbooks, the sales playbooks, the profit implementation playbooks, the delivery playbooks, and the notes that you didn't see about creating that.
(2:17:52) And $31 million of real cash value advisory work, real checks that were basically put that was money that people spent to help develop this for you. and more than two years of my life meeting with business owners 101 day in day out. These are the actual pictures. And before I tell you the additional books they need to donate to get this for free, let me just ask you a question.
(2:18:08) How much is knowing exactly what to do with your business worth to you? How much is getting the right strategy without years of trial and error worth to you? How much is having the answer to your biggest business problem in minutes to your exact specifications worth to you? How much is unlimited access to intelligence that never sleeps worth to you? Donating an extra thousand books to other entrepreneurs, extra 2,000 books, 5,000 books, 30,000 books.
(2:18:41) Hold that number in your head. If you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt this custom trend AI would help you solve your biggest constraint, which of course you can't because all business involves risk. Your execution will vary. But if it did, wouldn't it be worth at least that much? So, if I priced this at 2500 more books on top of the 200, I think it'd be beyond reasonable.
(2:19:05) 2500 more books to get $31 million of consulting value at your fingertips. And that's why the HQAI is definitely a bargain. And not 2500 more bucks, but a thousand more books. And consider this. If all this did was give you the one solution to the problem that's been holding your business back for years, or we let to see the opportunity from the outside of your industry that lets you leap frog all your competition, or save your business from one catastrophic mistake.
(2:19:32) If all it did was give you the confidence to make your next big move, knowing it's built on a foundation of hundreds of real world business solutions, businesses I actually work with, conversations with people in industries just like yours who are dealing with the same problems as you, wouldn't it be worth it? I think so, too. That's why I'm doing this.
(2:19:51) Which is why it's an even bigger bargain at not a thousand books, but 400 more books. Because even if only one single time you get one actual answer to your exact specification with 10 times the clarity at 100 times the speed, it's the same thing these highle business owners paid $135,000 for. And they did that because you only get that level of understanding by understanding the value of risk and speed. That's why people are willing to pay that kind of money.
(2:20:17) And the best part is for you, you who are watching me here right now, today live Sunday, is that you only have to invest once, but you get to leverage it to your exact specifications as many times as you want. Which is why leverage with skill is the best investment. Look, if I had taken that $31 million from the consulting and just parked it somewhere, it just be a pile of money.
(2:20:38) Who cares? But instead, I took two years of my life and the fruits of all that labor and put it into an AI tool you can use. So, which would you rather have? 400 books worth of cash or the help you need to get to where you want to go with the custom ACQAI train on everything 247 on demand. Right. Me, too.
(2:20:59) Which is why this may really be the best offer I've ever given at not 400 extra bucks, but only 200 extra bucks. Because I want each of you ultra ballers, the truly serious business owners to have an unfair advantage to 2x, 5x, or 10x your business over time. And I know how game-changing having the right answer at the right time has been for me.
(2:21:23) And I want this to be within your financial means, but still a serious decision. So I'm not going to ask you to donate 400 more bucks. I'm not even going to ask you to donate 200 more bucks. And given this tool adds clarity, structure, speed, volume, and wisdom.
(2:21:42) It only makes sense that it has a real cost and it only makes sense to do right by everyone who's ever invested in the development of this project. all the people who were who were behind me yesterday. Which is why I'm going to give you access to the ACQAIR custom train on everything. Two years of my life for an extra donation of a onetime extra donation of free with the original 200 book donation.
(2:22:13) So, yes, it's all included when you donate 200 bucks. All right, as my way of saying thank you to all the players for putting books in the hands of the entrepreneurs who need them. All right, you guys are all amazing. So, thank you guys so much. So, let me quickly recap what you're getting when you donate 200 books at go.acq.com.
(2:22:29) All right, so you're getting 200 books right off the bat. $5,998 value. On top of that, you're getting the lead system which includes GoDads playbook, the Hooks playbook, the branding playbook, the marketing machine playbook. The Hooks playbook is so underrated if you think about what this does. Like every single person who enters your business begins entering your world through a hook.
(2:22:48) Whatever it is, whether it's an email, a post, an ad, a piece of content, whatever it is, there's a hook the first thing. And if all you did was just double the effectiveness of the hooks across your business, nothing else would need to change and your business would double. That's not a promise that's going to happen for you. Your results will vary.
(2:23:04) But the idea is that if you can just execute this consistently, it could have tremendous impact on the business. That's just one of the four play playbooks you get in the lead system for free. And in the sales system, you're getting lead nurture, closing, and the proof checklist. Right now, like one of the things you can immediately do is create proof based assets. I talked yesterday about this at length.
(2:23:23) But right now, if people are taking way too long to close, it takes you long calls. It takes you multiple calls. The issue might not even be the script of the offer. It might be where and how you're implementing proof. This checklist solves that problem. So, just think fewer sales, more deals, higher close rate percentages. I'm saying that's the goal. Not saying that's going to happen for you. Most people do nothing. All right. So, you're going to get the lead system for free.
(2:23:41) You're getting the sales system for free. And you're getting the delivery system for free. So, you can juice LTV, keep people paying longer, uh, keep them sticky, and you're getting the profit system absolutely free.
(2:23:54) These are the fastest things that you can implement in a business tomorrow if you had to cover this donation. I'm not saying it will happen. I'm saying that's what I would do if I were you. Is the first things I would implement because you don't have to do anything. You don't have to change anything about business. just changing how you position your pricing.
(2:24:07) And you get the HCQ AI train on $31 million of consulting that includes all of this material that I just said custom trained to personalize it to your specific business the same way people who paid $135,000 paid me to customize to their business. That's why I trained it for two years to be able to actually deliver something valuable to you when you help me put 200 books in the hands of entrepreneurs who need them.
(2:24:31) But I've got one more free gift for you when you do the ACQ virtual implementation workshop. Let me get you a nice little nice pretty pretty setup here. There we go. Look at that. So to make sure you use the AI to the best of your ability, I want to walk you through the same process that people pay 35,000 or even $135,000 for and love it. All right. So when you donate 200 bucks, you'll also get the ACQ implementation virtual workshop.
(2:24:55) So, I'll be personally leading you through the entire implementation process to find the playbook that'll help give you the highest return today. The one which which one you'll need next and how to best use the ACQAI to implement it. At the virtual workshop, you'll identify which constraint gives you the maximum return on effort using our most effective frameworks to help you use HQAI to find and create leverage.
(2:25:19) Now, you'll pinpoint whether your bottleneck is demand or supply. And then you'll install what I call quad promotional funnels that allow you to scale across both sides of the business. You'll leave with a clear road map showing which playbook to start with for maximum impact personalized by the HQAI for your exact business. So here's the result.
(2:25:36) You'll get clear on what's holding you back and then know which playbooks to use to solve the issue and unlock what I call leverage growth and use ACQA to maximize it. So, if the playbook's your map, think of the HQAI as your vehicle and the workshop as your guide. An in-person version of this is $35,000 run by my team. I'm not involved. It's just my team and it's one day.
(2:26:03) The experience is this experience, this one right here, is virtual and it's led by me. So, that's the difference. That's the trade. But here's just a few happy stories of our in-person experience that my team runs. So, this is Joshua Thompson. I fought Alex's content for a long time. Expectations are high. Needless to say, they absolutely delivered. Uh, Happy Bay Construction.
(2:26:19) We've never been to event packs so much value in two days. Straight business worth every penny. Uh, Sarah, been to Vegas twice now. Can say without hesitation, help my business tremendously. Mike Lynch, one of the best highle business events I've been to. Recommend for any business owner. Uh, Julie, nearly instant ROI every time we come. Noble solid service.
(2:26:36) If you've ever gotten value video, let's be real, we all have. Imagine that times a thousand being blasted at you like a machine gun for two days straight. All right. So, like there's a lot of these and I could keep going. I could keep going. There's many, many, many of these.
(2:26:54) And you get access to the ACQ virtual work workshop for free when you support 200 entrepreneurs by donating books. All right. So, when you donate 200 bucks, you're going to get the lead system, all four playbooks free. You're going to get the sales system, all four playbooks free. You get the delivery system to juice the hell out of LTV so you can get your customers worth more so that you can spend more money to scale.
(2:27:10) so that you can spend more money on talent because customers worth more to you than they are to your competition and you're getting the profitation playbook. Three playbooks that you can instantly use inside of your business to drive bottom line, which one of the biggest things you can do in a business that requires little operational effort.
(2:27:29) On top of that, you're getting the ACQAI train on 226 one-to-one consultations with me that I did extensive amounts of work with uh so that we could find as many business prototypes onetoone with you is the best thing I could do is like okay well how do I consult with the 226 most common businesses that exist which then cover 80 90% 95% 98% of businesses out there. Again, that's not a promise.
(2:27:50) I'm just saying it's very likely that I not only work with one business like yours but multiple and the ACQ virtual impetation workshop. So help you guide you on how to use this tool, how to wield it because this is a tool, right? We have to I'll show you how we wield it internally because our team uses this too, right? So I mean this tool is my internal tool and you're like why would you give away something this valuable? Because I'm trying to I'm trying I was gonna say I'm trying to break the record but we already did. All right. I'm trying to put the the books in the hands of every entrepreneur in
(2:28:18) America, right? That's what I'm trying to do. If you're like, "Wow, that sounds absurd." That's why I'm doing this. And it's also why this is going to go away. And it's all free when you donate 200 bucks to other entrepreneurs. You can go to go.acq.com. So, if you want my competitive advantage to be yours for less than the cost of Chipotle Burrito every day, that's $8.
(2:28:40) 33 a day with a firm, you can go to go.acq.com right now. Now, I've seen many of you already donating books during this presentation, and it makes me incredibly grateful. So, thank you guys. Like, genuinely, thank you. Um, but I also know that some of you guys still might have a question or two.
(2:28:57) Before I bring up our five mystery headliners, which we won't because they actually went yesterday, let me address some of the questions that I expect people to have. So, first off, this is a significant commitment. So, let me be direct about something. If you've gotten value from my free nuggets, free YouTube videos, free podcast, free scaling roadmap, free audio books, free keynotes, free newsletter, free courses, free events, please donate some books, which you can do here, right now at go.acq.com.
(2:29:27) And if you haven't gotten value, then please don't. I really mean that. With that said, while you guys check out, I want to share something cool with you guys. Um, over the last year, I've been I've been studying uh something that I at least call riskreward decision-making frameworks of the wealthiest people in history.
(2:29:48) People like Rockefeller, Paul Getty, Bezos, Musk. And what amazed me was a common theme. These guys had to make huge bets and go allin multiple times. And those moments are the inflection points in their lives and wealth. You can watch it when you look at their wealth graphs over time. And so, for example, Elon, age 27, exits his first business, Zip 2, 22 million in cash. Most people would retire here.
(2:30:11) Instead, he goes all in his next thing, a payments platform. Then 31, exits PayPal, 175 million in cash. Most people would for sure retire here, but instead goes all in again on rockets, cars, and solar. Age 37, SpaceX almost runs out of money. He puts everything he has in and has his first successful launch on his fourth try.
(2:30:29) But wait, there's more. Age 46, Tesla's one month away from running out of money. risk his net worth to borrow money to float the company and turns the corner with the Model S. 54 now the richest man in the world with three of the most valuable companies ever in position for growth and the others have the same wild stories and understanding of risk and reward. Basos actually has two of my favorite quotes of all time on riskreward.
(2:30:53) One of them was the opener to my offers book. Outside returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you take that bet every time, but you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs.
(2:31:11) The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score a thousand runs. This longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold.
(2:31:31) Big winners pay for so many experiments. And the second is short and sweet and because of that it's easier to remember. Um so I think about this one a lot which is just that humans tend to overestimate risk and underestimate opportunity which led me to one large conclusion. History rewards us for being bold. Because I know some of you guys are stuck trying to figure out your next move, scaling like crazy trying to keep the wheels on the bus.
(2:31:56) And some of you guys are just trying to stop the bleeding. And I've noticed this common theme for myself. Every sticking point I reach in business, there's usually some big bet I have to make to get to the next level. And so I like to remind myself of this when I don't feel courageous.
(2:32:12) And so each of these figures had moments where they had to make high stakes decisions, not once, but multiple times and go allin again. And since decisions are the highest leverage actions we can take, I thought sharing some of the decision frameworks and bets that shape my career might be the highest value leverage that I can give you. Is that okay? I think they're cool. Okay, rock and roll.
(2:32:37) 10 decisions and frameworks that changed my life. Big decision number one, quitting my job to becoming an entrepreneur. So I'm on the phone with a close friend, Victor. He was my first free client, by the way. That's his before and after. Uh, pacing around my apartment for probably the 50th time, debating if I should quit my job and start a business or not.
(2:32:54) So, you know, I'm saying the normal thing, what if this doesn't work? What if I run out of money? What, you know, I'm doing okay? Why I change anything? I've got a lot going on right now. Things are super busy right now. And, you know, like a good friend, he listened and waited for me to list all my reasons. And then he said something I'll never forget.
(2:33:07) He said, "Dude, the only thing that's guaranteed is that if you risk nothing, you get nothing. it sounds like all your reasons not to do it are the reasons you should do it. And so we ended up both quitting our jobs after that conversation and I ended up driving across the country to become an entrepreneur.
(2:33:26) And I can safely say that that big bet, that big investment was one of the best decisions I ever made. And my friend Victor helped me, which led me to big decision number two, learning the gym business. So I find this gym expert on the internet and I drive across the country straight to his gym. So, believe it or not, this is actually the picture um that I sent him right outside when I got there.
(2:33:43) No idea what I'm doing. I just quit my job like a week ago and I'm just like completely like free in the wilderness like what is happening right now? And I took a picture in front of some random guy on the internet gym being like I'm here. So, after driving 36 hours, I really didn't know what to expect.
(2:34:03) And so, as soon as I sit down uh in in his office, he offers me to join a gym owners group for $10,000. So, I freeze up and I tell him, "Uh, I'm not sure about the point of my business career to make an investment like this." But Sam says, "Have you made a decision like this before?" I said, 'N no. He's like, "Well, you only have to answer three questions. If you answer no to any of them, don't do it." "Do you?" I said, "Okay.
(2:34:22) " He said, "Will this get you closer or further than your goals?" "Yes." "Okay." "Does it increase your chances versus doing your own?" I said, "Yes." "Okay." "Do you have access to money to get started?" "Yes or no." "Yes." He said, 'Well, since you said yes to all three, it's a logical decision, so I don't think you'll regret it. And so, I did it.
(2:34:39) I invested in me, and it ended up being one of the best investments I ever made. It was the first big domino that moved me in this direction to where I am today. And to be clear, that one group isn't why I'm here. But the decision to invest in learning skills is it was the first big investment I made.
(2:34:56) And so, I always frame these decisions directionally rather than absolutely. So, instead of asking, will this thing scale save XYZ my business? And the answer is it certainly won't. Only you can do that. But instead, I ask, does this get me closer or further from my goals? And for me, when the answer is yes, I move forward knowing I'll figure out the rest along the way, which you can do by going to the link at go.acq.com. And despite being terrified to spend that kind of money, I did.
(2:35:20) And that decision ended up being one of the largest factors to why I'm here today. So here's what happened next. I go to my first gym owners meeting. Remember, I don't own a gym here. And that led me to big decision number three. What kind of gym model should I start? So, I like bodybuilding. I liked powerlifting. I liked fitness stuff. And so, I show up to this meeting.
(2:35:39) I wasn't even sure I should be in a room like this. And my turn to talk comes up. And so, I say, I want to start a 10,000 foot gym. And the gym owners jumped on me and were like, "Never go above 5,000 feet for a training studio." I was like, "Oh, got it." All right. Noted. And then I mentioned specific equipment and I said, "This is what I want to get." And they said, "You don't need that. You know, you can get most of this stuff for 10 cents on the dollar at auctions.
(2:35:57) " I was like, "Oh, okay. Got it." Wrote that down. And then I was like, "Okay, I want to get retail space." So I'm thinking like five bucks a foot. And they said, "Oh, never go above 150." I was like, "Oh, God. Okay." And so in 30 minutes, they saved me five years and probably $250,000. I couldn't even got a higher ROI if I tried.
(2:36:15) And that's when I realized just how steep the price of ignorance is. It's a tax we all pay in time or money. And we pay with whatever we value least. But we pay the ignorance tax either way. The cost of not knowing. These decisions I made, to be clear, before I was ready. And I think of those decisions now like a rocket ship.
(2:36:35) Like a small directional change in the beginning can create huge changes down the line, good or bad. So sometimes starting before you're ready, is exactly when you benefit for the most. It's also why I secured financing through a firm, which works out to $249 a month for anyone who qualifies and wants to donate. You just go to go.acu.com. All right. Just remember to check out as a guest to use the financing. Um, and to be clear, don't be dumb.
(2:36:55) I just tried to make it so anyone who's motivated can donate and get it. Just hit the link at the bottom, you can walk through the steps. So anyways, the decisions that Sam and that group helped me make set me on this better path, which then led me to decision number four, starting my first gym with my partner who never was.
(2:37:13) So Sam connects with another gym owner in the area and says, "We should partner up, start a bigger gym together." So two weeks before the gym opens, my 2B partner says, "Hey, I think we should go to this workshop. is three grand, but they promise if you don't make 10 grand by the end of the workshop, you can get your money back. $3,000 was still a ton for me at the time. Um, but it sounded like stuff I needed to learn. So, I paid and I went with him to Vegas.
(2:37:31) Spoiler, I did not make $10,000. I didn't even make $1 from the workshop. But, I did learn a little skill called Facebook ads in 2012. And so, believe it or not, I actually just got this picture this year. So, a friend of mine that I've known for years, obviously now, he he looked through his phone memory and he took this picture of me at the workshop.
(2:37:48) This is me at the Arya in Vegas actually learning this. Anyways, I thought this was really cool. Like I have a picture of the exact moment. Um, and so my and so I I'll fast forward this. So my 2B partner didn't make $10,000 either. And he actually got upset and asked for a refund, but I didn't because I saw how I could use this to get people into the gym.
(2:38:12) And so the night before we had to sign the lease, my 2B partner, who never was, backed out. And so I had to come up with his half and my half, which is why I didn't have enough for two rents and slept on the floor. For those of you who know my story, but learning to run ads in exchange for a $3,000 investment, yeah, you could say it worked out for me long term. So the bottom line is this.
(2:38:36) For the right person, ROI should be the least of their concerns because to winners, learning skills is always worth it. And winners only become winners by taking action before they are. And that's how they win. But if you just need to take a bet on yourself, then do it. You're the only asset you can never lose. And so investing in you is the best long-term move you can make with this or anything.
(2:38:53) And I made it easy for you at go.acq.com. But that takes me to big decision number five. Find a way or make a way. So I open up my gym. I get chairs and a table from a dollar a dealership down the street. So there's actually a car dealership and they put this out on their front lawn. And I as I open my gym because I have no money.
(2:39:11) I only bought gym equipment. And then people were coming in being like, "Hey, uh, can I sign up?" And I didn't have a printer. I didn't have tables. I didn't have chairs. So like I think the first people I like walked around then realized this. I was like, "Oh my god, I need this." But these things cost money.
(2:39:22) So anyways, they gave them to me for free and I think I gave him like a month of membership or something. Anyways, so I run my ads and I signed up 22 members. And I actually remember texting this picture to my dad. Um, which is, you know, it's crazy. You know, the first probably the first five years of gym launch after this picture, I used to choke up every time I saw this picture.
(2:39:40) I have now habituated. Um, but like I I remember killing myself to get 22 members. Um, and I was super proud of it. It's why I splled it all out uh to, you know, show it off. And so anyways, one of those members changed my perspective. Her name was Jamie. And so, single mom, four kids, one job, comes in, says she wants to lose weight. I told her the price. She said she couldn't afford it.
(2:40:03) And so then I just paused as a good salesperson should. So then she finally said, "I'm going to do it anyways. I'll figure it out." And so she became a huge success story for me. And so much later I asked her, I was like, "Hey, what did you end up doing to pay for this?" And I asked so I could also tell other people, you know, who were saying they were struggling with, you know, financially or weren't sure. She said, "I just drove Uber one day a week when the kids were at their dads. I was just resourceful." It was so
(2:40:25) interesting to me because she taught me the difference between resources and resourcefulness. Everyone thinks you need the first when you really need the second. Whenever we have something tough that comes up, what do we do? We become resourceful. And so the thing is is that we only tend to be resourceful to things that come onto us rather than things we want.
(2:40:42) It's one of the interesting things about humans, right? Especially business owners. Like if you needed a if you had a big tax bill tomorrow, what would you do? You figure it out, right? If you have to pay payroll, what do you do? You figure it out. If you have to pay rent, what do you do? You figure it out.
(2:40:54) And so what's interesting is that when it's the government or when it's a landlord or when it's your employees, you always are resourceful. But when it comes to yourself, you stop being. And that resourcefulness is the thing that you need to get to the next level. Learning that skill, which it is a skill, it's a behavior set to be able to use it constantly, not always when you're just in need from external external threats.
(2:41:16) And so, as a single mom, you can imagine she could have easily said she didn't have the money, but it just came down to priorities. She just decided this was more important than the least important thing that she was doing and spending money on. And then she made the trade. And I think about this a lot because I'm like, if I want something, whatever it is, I want to make an investment, I want to I want to go somewhere, I want to buy something, whatever it is, right? I think to myself, of all the things that I do, and of all the things that I spend money on, is this thing more important
(2:41:42) to me than the least important thing that I spend time or money on? If the answer is yes, I trade up and I continue to make that trade. And if you keep making that trade, life gets better. And so in addition to that, if I think my situation is hard on a bad day, I think about Jamie and I'm reminded that there's always somebody who's had it worse and done better, right? And I found one of her first pro her first progress pictures and she actually ended up losing close to 100 pounds.
(2:42:07) It's not this picture, but I just thought it was kind of cool. I found this from 13 years ago. Um, this is actually Jamie. Kind of cool. So, and she did it by focusing on her resourcefulness, not her resources. And the best way to increase resourcefulness is to learn new skills. It is a behavior set. And so that's why I distilled all the practices into the playbooks and checklists.
(2:42:23) You can just follow them, right? Each playbook you can get through in one sitting. Like key point here, you can get through these in one sitting. It took me time that you don't have to pay to figure out the hundred ways to do these wrong with these playbooks. You can just start with what works.
(2:42:40) You stop wasting on time on what doesn't by donating 200 bucks at the link below at go.acq.com. So that led me to big decision number six, learning high ticket sales and high ticket services. So fast forward, my gym's growing, but not fast enough. So, I reached back out to the guy who ran that workshop. He had like 10 gyms at the time and I asked him, "Hey, you know, can you help me grow my gyms faster?" He said, "Sure.
(2:42:56) " And then he told me the largest price I'd ever heard. And of course, my initial reaction is, "Ah, I'm not sure." Right? He says, "I'm not here to convince you to spend money you don't have. My goal is to help you save time you haven't spent. You're going to have to figure this out to get to where you want to go. So, you're going to buy the lessons either way.
(2:43:14) And everything you're telling me is that your business isn't growing fast enough. So, you're already paying for this with time. So the question is, is that how you will keep paying? Is that how you still want to pay? Because you can pay with time or money, but only one of them you can get back.
(2:43:30) Which is why I made this to save you time and money. So if you're ready to avoid the ignorance tax, the only kind of legal tax you can avoid, by the way, you can go to go.acq.com and you can see get all the stuff that's pictured below. So I end up making the investment and this guy was in Australia. So, I did it and I flew across the world and I learned about semi-privates and how to sell higher ticket services.
(2:43:49) And these pictures, by the way, when I got there, he was like busy working. And so, he just had his secretary basically take me around town for the day. And I have 57 images of me in front of just like all these random landmarks inside of Melbourne.
(2:44:06) Um, just me and like in my 20s just like I don't know, I'm just flexing around because I'm here to learn about this stuff. Um, but I did end up learning it and you could say that it absolutely changed my life. But it was a huge bet at the time, which led me to big decision number seven, going allin on the skills needed for Gym Launch. So, I only knew how to run ads locally.
(2:44:23) I needed to learn how to run them globally. And I reached out to a bunch of agencies, but I couldn't afford their services. And so, finally, get on the phone with one guy and I ask him if he'll just tutor me. He says no. But I was desperate. So, I asked, "What would it take?" Which, by the way, way better question to ask yourself and others if you truly want something.
(2:44:40) Anyways, he says more than I was prepared for, so I hesitated. So anyways, um he says, "Think about it like this. Over the next 12 months, you're going to spend this money either way. That money's already gone." So it's not about spending it, it's about where it goes.
(2:44:57) So are you going to keep spending it on stuff that doesn't move the needle? Ads that flop, leads you waste, sales you don't close, people who turn out because you don't know how to fix it, hires that you that don't deliver, you not having a brand even though you keep trying, or you can exchange it for something that builds your business. because money only has value when it's exchanged for something better.
(2:45:14) And what's a better trade than the skills you need to build the business you want? And so I did it and became the best student I possibly could and learned what I needed to advertise B2B and start launching gyms, which ended up being one of the best investments I ever made.
(2:45:30) And my hope is to provide you the same opportunity for you and 200 other entrepreneurs, which you can support by donating books at the link below. Again, your life will be different from mine. All right? So will your results. I share these to explain how I made the decisions that changed my life. Not to guarantee any outcome for yours. Big decision number eight, my next big bet on skills.
(2:45:48) So, fast forward, gym launch works, but we've plateaued for three years. I'm stuck at $30ish million dollars a year. And I get on this podcast and I talk about a company that I'm a huge fan of. The host after the podcast says the founder is a personal friend and he can make an intro. So, I asked him to and he did.
(2:46:01) And at the time, the founder said his company was doing a billion dollars a year in sales. This guy was the richest person I'd ever spoken to at the time. So, we talked for a while and I ask him what he thinks that I should do to get unstuck. So, he tells me this. He says, "Well, sounds like you need a different way to advertise.
(2:46:17) " And so, I counter with, "Well, I've tried some stuff in the past and didn't work out. I'm not sure if that'll work. Let me just see if my current initiatives will work out. I've got some, you know, I've got some coals in the fire." And this guy does not need to help me. But he drops this bomb on me. He says, "If you've done something in the past and it didn't work, the only thing worse than making one bad investment is letting a bad investment prevent you from making a good one.
(2:46:35) And if you do, you let the bad investment burn you twice." And then he follows up. He says, "Listen, imagine you could go back in time and talk to your younger self opening your first gym." I said, "Yeah, okay." He said, "Would you have things to tell him about what to do differently?" I said, "Yeah, of course.
(2:46:59) " He said, 'Right, but now imagine younger you doesn't listen and says,"I'm super busy right now. I've got a lot of coals in the fire. I'll get to that later." He says, 'You get it? That's what I'm trying to do for you right now. You're only hesitant because you can quantify what you have to lose, but not what you stand to gain. And that's why making big bets is so hard and why so few people make them.
(2:47:18) So, I made the investment of time and money into content. I listened to his advice and it was one of the best investments I ever made. despite being unsure of it at the time. And so if you're feeling any of those same hesitations, that might be your business telling you exactly what it needs.
(2:47:33) It isn't about the timing being perfect. It's about solving what's making the timing feel imperfect. And so if that sounds logical, go donate some books. If it doesn't, it's cool, too. Which led me to big decision number nine. So there are moments in your life where everything branches, right? You can probably think of some now.
(2:47:51) if I hadn't gone to that coffee shop or signed up for that class, you know, this great thing wouldn't have happened. So, for me, one happened eight and a half years ago when I was swiping on my phone during lunch. So, I saw a fit Persian chick and I figured why not? So, I swiped right. But I think about this a lot because like what if I hadn't swiped the other way? Like, I wouldn't have met her.
(2:48:08) And I shudder to think about what my life would have been like without Ila. Like, and I think about this because without her, like I wouldn't be where I am today. And the thing is that there's a version of you six months or six years from now looking back on this moment wondering what if I hadn't taken that step, right? What if I hadn't gotten the tools I needed? That piece that then fixed the business, that thing that fixed turn, that thing that fixed our our sales, that thing that fixed our show rates, the thing that fixed our ads, the thing that fixed our content, the thing that got our brand actually spinning. What if
(2:48:32) I hadn't had that piece that's been pivotal to us getting to the next level? What if I hadn't done that? Which is why it's important to take the leap and be bold. So if you feel like taking the leap and being bold, you can go donate books, help 200 other entrepreneurs, and you get everything you see in front of me.
(2:48:50) You can go to go.acq.com. Which then brings me to one of the biggest leaps that we made together. Decision number 10, buying this building. So we weren't sure if it made sense for us to get a building, definitely not this big. And we were considering the decision. We came down to this framework.
(2:49:09) When we're old, will this matter? When we're 85 and looking back on today, if we do this, is it going to change the outcome? Well, if it doesn't work out and we're 85, we're looking back, is it really going to change anything if we bought the building or not? Probably not. But if it does work out, could change everything because the downside's limited. We could sell this building. Not a huge deal.
(2:49:27) You could sell these books. That's the downside. You can just sell the books. Not a huge deal. But the upside is unlimited. We could turn this into a campus for talent, culture, team, clients, and build the life we want, which is a framework that we use a lot when we're thinking about bets. What if it goes wrong and what if it works? And no matter what, we figured we do what we always do.
(2:49:46) If something bad happens, we just figure it out. We're resourceful. And so, we let the investment be something that motivated us rather than made us hesitant. So that like that that stomachy feeling like right before you're about to click a button, right before you're about to make a move, like that little feeling, I have trained myself to know and identify that feeling as a good feeling rather than a bad feeling. Instead of it being anxiety, it's excitement.
(2:50:11) It's something about me about to make a decision, me stepping into a new identity, me stepping into a behavior set that is that is foreign to me, but might be the behavior set that I need to step into to get to where I want to go. because buying this building and our annex now the second building on our campus have been some of the best investments we've ever made despite being unsure turned out better than expected and so if you have questions about your business that's why I made ACQAI that's why I spent two years with 226 businesses one-on-one doing so many days
(2:50:40) of work that did not scale was to create something that could so it could help and why we have a whole day dedicated to making sure they have exactly what you need at the virtual invitation workshop out that people pay $35,000 plus for in person for my team and I will be leading you through the whole day virtually and that's so that you can use these these tools to your advantage.
(2:51:05) So those are the 10 decisions and frames that helped me make some of the biggest bets and investments in my life that paid off. Was that helpful for you guys? Because I know some of you guys are stuck trying to figure out your next move. Scaling like crazy trying to trying to keep the wheels on the bus. And some of you guys are trying to stop the bleeding. And going all in, taking the leap may be the best thing you do.
(2:51:29) At least it has been for Rockefeller, Paul Getty, Basos, Musk, and it certainly has been for me. To be clear, I'm not saying what happened for me will happen for you. You can't make the same decisions as me. Your life is unique. So is your yours and your results will vary. Right? And to re quote Bezos, humans tend to overestimate risk and underestimate opportunity.
(2:51:53) This longtail distribution of returns, it's why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments. We are rewarded for being bold. That said, for those of you who are motivated to be bold and take action now, I've got one more surprise free gift for you for helping me help 200 entrepreneurs, but it disappears the moment this live stream ends.
(2:52:19) The 100 million launch blueprint available now only on this live stream. So, this is different from yesterday, by the way. Most business owners are terrible at launching things. They post once on social media and send a single email. Nobody cares. and they wonder why. Then they watch competitors with inferior products destroy them simply because they know how to create demand.
(2:52:38) I spent the last 14 years mastering the art of launches. From flying city to city, launching gyms, living out of extended stays when I was dead broke to launching supplements that did $74 million in sales with almost 400,000 orders to launching software that hit 15 million users to launching books that shattered records, both topping the all of Amazon lists.
(2:53:01) Launching is how I built what I have. This launch that you're watching right now, I invested $4 million in ads alone to execute. There you go. There are the receipts. And it just broke a world record. One that literally nine out of 10 of the people who had this record beforehand were literally world leaders. Like I can't emphasize this.
(2:53:28) Like if you learn these skills, you can change your life. And I'm not saying you have to do it with this. This is just a way that I can hopefully incentivize the business owners to donate other books to other entrepreneurs because I had to come up with something.
(2:53:46) And so every email, every ad, every piece of content was strategically designed to create maximum engagement, maximum impact. And so here's everything I spent 14 years learning, two years assembling this whole plan, and millions to create for this record-breaking launch. So, here's what's inside. You'll get the email and SMS sequences that drove hundreds of thousands of registrations.
(2:54:04) I think as of yesterday morning was 580,000 registrations. Uh, you get the video sales letters, five different VSSL scripts that converted cold traffic. You'll get paid ads, thousand plus ads that profitably scaled this launch. This complete webinar, which I think is 1,700 slides, transcript and production notes, and the launch timeline, day-by-day blueprint for recreating this exact launch. launch memos.
(2:54:28) Our internal documents I think is one of the most valuable things uh we have because like your ability to make high quality decisions with high stakes is going to be the thing that allocates the resources you have against the highest leverage opportunities that exist. And if you do that, you will move forward faster than other people who have the same resources as you.
(2:54:45) This is how two people can start with nothing and one can achieve something is because of leverage. How do you get leverage when you have nothing? Skills. And so the launch memos explain our internal documents that explain the strategy and thinking behind the launch and the two book bundles, the 200 and the 800. All right, the 800's for anybody who's a super baller. It's on the thank you page.
(2:55:04) I don't spend too much time talking about it because it's only for super ballers. You know who you are. All right, but for everyone else, it explains all of that. Now, this launch blueprint, let me explain why I think this is so so wly misunderstood by most business owners. From launching a lemonade stand to launching the iPhone, every business of every size needs to launch stuff. You need to make your offers available. This was something that took me way too long to learn in the beginning of my career.
(2:55:31) From launching new products to new locations to new services to new features to new events, the difference between businesses that explode and businesses that die is their ability to channel demand into buying behavior. These assets work. The same psychology works whether you're launching to 100 people or 100,000 people.
(2:55:47) You're getting the exact multi-million dollar assets that just shattered a world record. Like no one else, literally no one else can say that, but only if you donate while this live stream is on. The moment the live stream ends, it will no longer be available. And so this is your final chance to get the launch blueprint worth more to me than just about anything.
(2:56:12) And so if you want to master a core skill that built my material wealth and get everything we use to break records, go to go.acq.com acq.com right now before it's gone. And so special note, the live only bonus launch collateral, this stuff is digital unlike all of these playbooks. And the main reason is because we're still doing the launch. All right? So we couldn't print it ahead of time.
(2:56:30) Now, this offer won't be for sale uh after the launch. So if you want it, you need to check out at the link below right now at go.acq.com. And this implementation mega system is first come, first serve. So when you help me on this mission, my hope is that I not only help you achieve yours, but that we together can help 200 other entrepreneurs save their businesses, save the world.
(2:56:50) So that's why I'm trying so hard and spent so many countless hours doing the absolute sheer volume of work, the unscalable over two years to make all of this for you. This was an absolutely mind like melting amount of work to do this to actually create something that would really help. And so let me tell you everything you're getting when you support 200 other entrepreneurs at go.acq.com.
(2:57:12) So when you donate 200 bucks, you're getting 200 bucks right off the bat. You're getting 200 bucks. It's real value. You could you can do a lot of things with that. All right. On top of that, you're getting the lead system which includes goated ads, hooks, branding, and the marketing machine so that you can really scale your content, really scale your ads.
(2:57:30) This machine gives you fresh uh content to make every single week without you creating content. It creates it for you. All right, that's the first four playbooks of the lead system free. Next, you get the sales implicitation system, which includes lead nurture, so you can get them to schedule, get them to show. Once they show, you have the closing playbook to help you actually close the deal.
(2:57:48) And if they're taking too long, that's what the proof checklist is for, so you can streamline the progress process, and then diagnose your entire funnel or sales motion to figure out where the holes are, where you need to insert proof. Like, this thing is awesome. You get all three of those for free when you donate 200 bucks. On top of that, in the delivery system, you get the lifetime value and retention, so you stop losing customers on the back end, and you make them worth more to you than anybody else free. On top of that, you get the profit system, which includes fast cash, pricing, and the price raise uh letter
(2:58:12) playbook. Fast cash are these instant plays. You can just literally just they're already pre-made. You just fill in the blank and send them. You can put them on a cadence. They are things that drop disproportionately the bottom line uh because every business has existing customers or at least a business that has customers has uh a list that you can hit and using this is one of the fastest ways you can generate cash flow in a business. I'm not saying that's going to happen for you and saying that's how it works. Same thing with pricing and price
(2:58:35) raise letter. You can literally send them and immediately see changes in the business. They're the lowest operational drag things you can do. That's all 12 playbooks you get for free. On top of that, you get ACQAI trained on all of those playbooks. 226 plus consultations. the unwritten notes for all three of my books.
(2:58:52) The unwritten notes for all of the playbooks on top of that to train on business is probably identical to yours, both bigger or smaller, and the same size, so you know exactly what to do next. And you can ask the specific questions to get specific answers. And to make sure that you know how to wield this tool with skill, we have the virtual implementation workshop.
(2:59:10) They'll be leading you through that people pay $35,000 plus for that I will be leading virtually. And you can invite friends, my friends, I mean your employees, uh, to come too. All right. And while the live stream is on, the launch blueprint, which contains the collateral for this launch that broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling non-fiction of all time, like literally no one else could say that.
(2:59:34) And this took two years to put together and plan. And you'll get the internal memos from months and months and months ago of putting each of the pieces in place. And I promise you, the little breakdowns that you're going to see on X and LinkedIn, they do not know what they're talking about. that will show you why this worked and how you can model it to launch whatever it is that you want to launch.
(2:59:56) New locations, new services, new businesses, new products, new events, anything you want, you can launch using this framework. And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate books to get everything in your hands for as little as $249 a month interest free. And if you aren't seeing a firm, just hit the top right, check out his guest. Uh, and it's also at the bottom of the page.
(3:00:12) You'll also see it right above the thing. you hit the button after you've made sure that you put in your address, uh, it'll pop out. All right? And if you have any issues checking out, hired and trained 300 plus phone reps to help you. Uh, so you'll see their number on any failed checkout. Just call them and they'll help. All right? So, let's do best case, worst case scenario.
(3:00:31) I think I've covered best case scenario, but big picture, you change your life forever. Your business scales faster than you thought possible. Save the world. All right? That one's pretty clear, but let's talk about worst case scenario. So, right off the bat, you get a 100% dollar for-doll tax writeoff as a business. Number one. Number two, instead of giving these away, you could just literally resell all 200 yourself and then just keep the bonuses if you wanted to.
(3:00:54) And to give you context on this, we sell lots of books like before this launch too. So before this launch even started, sold 1.3 million copies of the book. So we sell thousands every day. So if you wanted to, there is demand for these. These retain their value. So you are getting 200 books on top of this. Everything else is just free. You could also use these books as lead magnets.
(3:01:11) I've already seen so many people like getting people to join groups, getting people to hop on calls, getting people to show up. Uh they just use these as lead magnets to get people to take actions, to get prospects to turn into customers, or as gifts to new customers, or as a bonus for joining a community or coming to an event or a great one, leaving a testimonial or review, or as an onboarding gift for new employees. This is actually a big surprising one.
(3:01:31) One of our largest use cases of of bulk buying for books is actually uh companies that hire uh they basically train all their employees using the $100 million series. So it was one that I didn't expect but pretty awesome. And all of those use cases, all of that worst case scenario is before you even use a single tactic from all four of the lead system, the sales system, the delivery system, the profit system.
(3:01:50) That's before asking the HQ AI even a single question. That's before the value multiplication that you're going to get and the skills you're going to learn at the ACQ workshop. And that's before deploying even a single artifact from the launch blueprint. I feel like it's a pretty amazing worst case scenario. 100% tax deduction for the business. Sell the books to recoup some or all the costs.
(3:02:10) Give as a gift to new customers. Use as a lead magnet. Give as a gift to join a community like school. Use them as an onboarding training or a new employee gift. Gift bonus given at your next, you know, event or meetup. Plus, you just feel good about helping 199 other entrepreneurs grow their businesses. Just a quick reminder, but for those of you who just want to do good, but don't want to take the time to give them away.
(3:02:29) We will gladly handle the distribution of books. It was the number one request from last year from people who did uh who who ordered more for distribution. All right? But if you want some of them, just use the code you get in your email to get free books. Whatever you don't want, we'll donate the rest. All right? And the codes are good for a year. So use whatever you want. Everything you don't will donate.
(3:02:46) So here's what happens next. Go to the link at the bottom of the screen. Go.acq.com. Hit this button. Check out. If you have any issue checking out, call the number that pops up. And for the larger businesses, which is about 15% of you here, I put took a couple screenshots from inside the community for the largest business owners who already donated more books, which is awesome.
(3:03:09) Uh, but for the larger ballers that are here, uh, I do have a special thing for you guys on the thank you page. You guys already know who you are. Um, and it's just a onetime thing that I'm doing only for this launch. It's the number one request I've had uh, over the last four years, and it's something that I'm only doing for six months just because I really want to hit this goal.
(3:03:28) All right? And so there's a short video on the next page showing how you can get access to me for six months, meet each other, and some other cool stuff if you choose to donate even more books. All right, it's a onetime thing I'm only doing for this launch. There's more details inside. All right, and I did it this way mostly to create a barrier so only somebody who could spend uh that without needing a sales call or convincing would be in.
(3:03:41) Right now, I think there's only like 400ish people in the group. It's not not very like that's not very hard to to manage. Um so like it's a it's a screaming a smoking deal right now. And you can upgrade your order with a click at checkout. All right, but you got to donate 200 books first to get that one. All right, so that's the deal. So do that first.
(3:03:59) But the launch bonus disappears the moment the live stream ends. So if you want that, go to go.acq.com. Um, and so here's what you're getting. Huzzah. All right. Now, perhaps I will have my lovely assistant. And I will remind you, as long as this live stream is on, you can get this. But the moment the live stream ends, the launch blueprint disappears. $100 million men.
(3:04:22) Can you please assemble our our getup our uh our Hermosi hotline? I'm not green. You're not green, but here I am. And we have somebody from Guinness is coming out. All right. Share some news. Yes. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you today? Good. Good. How are you? Good. Hi. Hi everyone.

And the title is the fastest selling non-fiction book. And your final result is 2 million 917,000 443 copies sold within 24 hours. That is a new Guinness World Records title. Congratulations, Alex. You are officially amazing.
(3:05:26) Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Would you like to share? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Here we go. Yes. Together. We'll go on both sides. We'll go on both sides. There we go. Here we go. We'll do it like this. Greenman, we got it. We got it. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, thank you so much.
(3:05:52) So amazing. Oh, cheers. I just want to I just want to remind that for for non-fiction, we just have to get to 3 million copies in 48 hours to beat HP number four. Is that really what it is? Go of fire. It's 48 hours. Mhm. They did in 48. So we have 48 hours to So I think we've got I think we got give it 60 minutes and we're going to beat Harry Potter Goblet of Fire.
(3:06:14) Well, let's rock and roll then. All right, Green M. Assemble the table. Yeah, assemble. Yeah, like release the Kraken. All right, guys. So, we're gonna we're gonna do a little hormone hotline because honestly, it was like you guys liked it and it's like one of the few things that I really enjoy. Um, hang out with me.
(3:06:31) Hang hanging out with Yes. Thank you, sir. All right. Thank you. Okay. This is fun. You want some paper? Do I want some paper? Should we get paper? Oh, yeah. We get some paper. Let's get some paper going. All right. You guys are awesome, by the way. I appreciate you.
(3:06:54) um like we couldn't do like I didn't say this yesterday. No, I did say this yesterday, but some of you guys who weren't there, I'll just tell you guys right now. Um a little bit more. I read you a little bit of that letter, but I'll tell you tell you some more behind that. So, when I was looking at, you know, launching this book, I looked at what the the records for non-fiction were.
(3:07:12) And what was crazy is that like nine out of the top 10, it might have be 10 out of the top 10 were all politicians. And I was like, we are the ones who who spend we're the ones who get taxed. We're the ones who fund all of the the media that that funds all these politicians. And I was like, and they're the ones who who have all the records for non non-fiction.
(3:07:31) I was like, that feels bad. And um I thought one of us should to should own that, right, as an entrepreneur, like one of the entrepreneurs should own that. Um, and so, you know, that was one of the one of the big catalysts for for organizing this whole thing and doing multiple years of work to put this together.
(3:07:50) So, without further ado, Hermosi Hotline. Herozi Hotline is now open for business. All right. And we will put the phone facing down so we do not show your phone numbers. All right. Got Corey Reed. His business is Altter Capital Group. It's lending. Okay. Revenue is 3 million. Profit is 1.9 million. We're going to give Corey a call.
(3:08:08) All right. Corey, let's rock and roll. Hello. Hey, Corey. What's up, man? Hey, what's going on? What's revenue? What's the problem? How can we help? So, re uh problem that I would What' you say? Revenue was three million. Three million. Okay. Yeah. So problem is in our business uh sometimes or actually a lot of the time there might not be anything that we could sell them necessarily today.
(3:08:45) We we work in private lending for investment property and so these people often times they are you know highly qualified. They're they're doing deals. Uh they've done deals. Maybe they just don't have a property that they need financing for like when that initial call happens.
(3:09:07) And so it makes that initial like framework of that call difficult for us and then turns the business into like a highly nurtured driven business in terms of staying relevant so that at the right time. But my question is like specifically like kind of like developing that closing framework like at least to be able to have like a solid framework for that initial call um so that we can have the best chance you know moving forward um in case there's not something that we can you know deliver on for them on that initial call. So I think big picture you need a reason
(3:09:39) why to move forward today to create some sort of activation point within the relationship. Right. Exactly. Right. So I'll tell you something. So, I'm actually a member of a platform that does uh M&A for like uh $1 million to $100 million checks.
(3:09:58) And one of the things that that platform did that worked, I mean, pretty good for me was it's just 10 grand a year. And they basically just pre-qualify and vet all my stuff so that they can they can um fund me way faster. And so, by doing that, they could basically transition me from being a prospect to a customer.
(3:10:15) And then whenever I reach out, they are the first people I'm thinking about because I already have like basically a $10,000 a year subscription, right? So the question is what other things would someone be willing to subscribe to that would add value to them? Now obviously for them it's going to be the likelihood of getting completed uh the speed of of the lending.
(3:10:34) And so it's like can we do more pre-diligence? Can we do like how much of this can we take up so that we can provide more value to them? Because fundamentally if you think about value from the value equation, right? You've got how can I make it risk-f free? How can I make it fast? how can I make it easy? So those are your vectors for value creation. And so we want to do that as the core elements of the offer that we get them to say yes to today.
(3:10:51) If we're trying to transact in some way to activate them. Now maybe activation for you guys might be like you might find out it's just meeting them in person, right? So like if if it's a cash flow issue, then we'd want to have some sort of transaction. If it's not a cash flow thing and you just need to have some sort of higher investment for some of these guys, just meeting them in person might be more meaningful than than paying $10,000, right? actually taking the time. Yeah.
(3:11:14) I mean, essentially all we've been doing in that call is is is essentially like gathering data, asking questions, and then delivering information about us and then effectively from there trying to kind of stay top of mind in in outside communications so that when they have an investment property that they are looking to acquire, you know, we can then like step in and be the financing uh arm for them on that.
(3:11:43) Um, but it just it just can become uh difficult I I guess uh especially if we're not saying or doing the right things in that sort of opening appointment where we're you know introducing ourselves and then vice versa. So are you opposed to doing the model where you essentially have people pay to get pre-qualified and already have done diligence on their company? No, but it's uh it's aren't unconventional in the sense that like uh well conventional is that you're having the problems that you're having right now, right? No, no. I I I don't mean like your
(3:12:16) strategy is unconventional. I just mean like in terms of our like lending process in the sense that uh I guess like in a a conventional loan scenario like where if you were going to buy like a personal house, you could pre-qualify somebody financially creditworthiness and then Right. And you have the is deal by deal.
(3:12:33) Yeah, I got it. Yeah. For us, it's very much asset based. So, as much as we we would want to be able to pre-qualify like the person individually if they come to us with a a deal that's not financable, then, you know, we're we're kind of stuck in the mud there.
(3:12:50) Is there any way that you could give them essentially like an estimate on their pre-qualification based on the kind of asset they're going to bring to you? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we get very like granular in terms of like the types of assets that we're willing to finance and, you know, all of the specifics with regard to that. Yeah, we we can definitely get pretty granular on that. I mean, yeah, I would do that.
(3:13:13) Well, part of the things that I'll say this, man, is that like it may be a feature, not a bug, which sometimes happens within businesses, right? Like trying to like So, I'll say this, and this goes for anyone. There's a lot of times where you spend inordinate amounts of mental effort trying to solve a problem that is unsolvable. Like, so I'll give you an example.
(3:13:34) So if I were to if I were to cater to, you know, people who want to start a business and I had a subscription software, right, I should expect that I'm never going to get to 100% retention. Why? It's structural. It's a feature, not a bug. Because there's just so many people who are, you know, entrepreneurs or people who are interested in in business, but, you know, don't have the commitment, don't have the consistency, haven't really gotten going yet that it would be ridic like that's about them, not about the product, right? And so Shopify doesn't beat itself up because they only keep
(3:13:58) 60% of customers every year. They just know that a certain percent will eventually succeed and that's where they actually make their money, right? And so to the same degree, there are structural things within the business that you're in, which is that you have to um base your uh you have to base your lending on the on the underlying asset, right? And so if I'm thinking like I'll say this, I think the original question that you started the conversation with might have been the wrong question for you to actually scale
(3:14:23) because it's it's unlikely that that's even the limitation of the business because fundamentally right now we need to get more people in front of you and then is the is the truth like do you have cash flow issues right now? Are you like struggling to pay bills? No, not not at all. Okay.
(3:14:41) So then so then there's basically there's no advantage to you convert increasing the cash conversion cycle right now. It it doesn't matter. So what really needs to happen which is completely outside of the original question frame is how do we increase the promotional activities that get people to find out about who you are so you can do more deals and is there some sort of retention mechanism which I would cover in the delivery systems that we talk about um and LTV of how can we can put this in on a consistent basis uh to reactivate and re-engage people on a more uh on a cadence.
(3:15:08) Got it right? because that's where the two levers are going to be in the business that are also going to allow you to scale more so than this what I would just consider an inconvenience or fact of life for the business. Right. Right.
(3:15:25) I mean it's kind of the same with like you know we talked yesterday about um when Alex you know quote interviewed me for the money model for acquisition.com. It's like I'm not going to say like you know what I really wish that I didn't have to spend so much time and effort to get someone to want to be a portfolio company.
(3:15:38) It's like okay actually how can we just get paid more for that time and effort and how can we make it easier? I think it's the same with this situation, which is you're not trying to get rid of it. You're just trying to make it more ROI positive for you, but like what Alex said, which is like, but is that the constraint of the business? And if it's not, then it's like, would you get a higher return just getting more customers? Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah.
(3:15:55) I guess I was just viewing it from like a like a a KPI standpoint. It like seemed like it would be like on the lower end in terms of like our ability to just like convert these leads into paying customers. And so I guess that was the only reason why I was trying to address it was that I felt like it was a bottleneck in that sense. But may maybe it's not. No, I don't think so, man. Well, maybe that was the most value I can do is just reallocate your resources.
(3:16:18) The thing that's going to get you the highest return. This isn't the thing that's going to the highest return. Yeah. It's also like we've talked to a lot of businesses in lending like this is fairly likeal. It's just what it is. It's normal. That's not the thing you need though. You need more. You need more deal flow. Right. Right. Of course. Yeah. Heard. All right. I appreciate you, man. Yeah. Thank you guys. Appreciate you.
(3:16:34) You bet. Donate some books. I trust me, I am. Oh, thank you, man. I appreciate that. And thank you on behalf of the other 200 entrepreneurs uh that are getting those books. So, thank you. Absolutely. It'll be a lot more than 200, man. Okay. Well, rock and roll, man. Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate you guys. Appreciate you.
(3:16:51) Appreciate you. All right. We've got Timothy Shucker. All right. Business is advanced agent marketing agency. Okay. Revenue 4.8 million. profit 25% profit margin. So 4.8 top line 25% margins marketing agency. All right. All right Timmy. Oops. Oh [ __ ] What happened? Oh, there we go. Cover it.
(3:17:21) Hey Tim, can you hear us? Lou and clear. How's it going? What's up? Not much. Just watching the live stream. All right. So, uh, 4.8 topline, 1.2 million bottom line. What's the issue? Where do you want to go? What's the problem? Yeah. So, the short-term goal is getting to a million a month. Okay.
(3:17:40) So, we're pressing the foot on the gas in terms of scale. Okay. Um, we're at a similar revenue level. I was watching the stream yesterday, you talked about uh at Jim launch before you guys added in the back end and the continuity. Yeah. That you guys were around the same level as we are.
(3:17:58) And so, like our back end and our continuity I feel like could use some work. Yeah. But really just want to kind of get an idea of what the highest leverage moves are for us in terms of where we are to I mean basically we're talking about tripling. Yeah. While also keeping the profit margin at a solid level. All right. You want to you want to What's your price and who do you sell to? Yeah. So we sell to insurance agents.
(3:18:26) Uh it's like a $15,000 offer. 15K for three months. Okay. And it's basically it's like a marketing package. So essentially we help them brand themselves so that they're viewed as an expert. Okay. Heard. Wait. So it's it's not just it's a branding package, not running paid ads. It's a combo, right? So like basically we put them in the ad and then we put them in like a video where by the time they go through the whole process it's like they're seeing the agent's face over and over versus just like buying leads and then cold calling people.
(3:18:57) So are you putting content on social media for them or are you just doing like um campaigns and retargeting campaigns and what is it just it's yeah it's mainly paid ads like it's the posting on social is not part of the service delivery. It could be, but to be honest, like most of them are not gonna do that. So, do you say that you like I like this is this is just us us girls talking.
(3:19:23) Um, do you tell them that you're building them a brand, but you really just like run ads for them and generate leads? Uh, well, the whole idea is we call it the personal brand funnel. Uhhuh. So, they are building a brand because they're the Facebook, but it's not like we're like posting and building like an Instagram or anything.
(3:19:40) So, so you're basically just getting them in ads and then running ads. but they're in there. I have a question. Do you know what percentage of payments fail and what percentage of customers pay in full the 15k over three months? Um, I mean, we've been running the 15K offer since April.
(3:19:58) Our payment completion rate on the 15K is pretty solid. Okay. Exact metrics. I don't I don't know what's what's CAC top. What's CAC? Uh, the CAC is like 3500. What's LTV fully loaded? Um to be honest I uh I don't have like those numbers right in front of me. What what like you wanted to get to change quite a bit.
(3:20:24) How many customers do you get per month and how many customers do you have active right now? We get about 50 a month. It's scaling up currently but currently in our group we have over 250 people. Okay. So do you know what churn is of so after the 15k what do they what do they pay for? So that's kind of like that's kind of what we're trying to create and structure.
(3:20:46) So basically what we've been doing now is my business partner is just jumping on back in sales and trying to reenroll people. Um but the idea would basically be to like help them scale their agency, help them scale their brokerage. Yeah. And then just you know ideally a 5k per month retainer would be what we would shoot for but we've had a couple people take that. Honestly like the take rate on that has not been as high as we would like. herd.
(3:21:10) Let me just let me give you some let me give you some nugs. All right. So, thing one, if he's trying to sell them on the back end, you're too late. You want to get the renewal before the end of the third month. So, you want to be looking at getting the renewal at like end of month one, halfway through month two. You want to be you want to have them still in cycle, not like this is now a new purchasing decision.
(3:21:30) So, it's more like let's keep the party going, not like now, do you want to take the next step? All right, to be clear, that's number one. So, from a timing perspective, uh, number two, I think you need to have a better offer uh, for the back end. And so, what I would do is like maybe it's a so they bought three and you say, "Hey, uh, if you basically let's get you let's roll this forward for another three. Um, and we'll roll your last month into the next month.
(3:21:55) " So, basically, it's like you buy you buy two, get one on the back. So, then it's $10,000 for three months as a continuity. And the main reason I can take that $5,000 off is because the setup that we did up front, we don't have to do it again. So, I'm willing to do that, right? Because the thing that you're actually looking for, I'm just telling you right now.
(3:22:17) So, if you're selling 50 deals a month, if you want to get to a million dollars a month, you need LTV to be 20K. And right now, you're close, which means that I'm going to guess that your conversion on the back, I mean, you already said it, is pretty bad, right? I mean, honestly, up until very recently, we had the CSMS trying to do it and they just weren't right. They're not sales. No, heard. Yeah,
(3:22:37) I I got you. Yeah. Also, the other piece is like an interesting option here is that you can just like there's there's two that come straight to mind for me. One is that you just sell the 15 for three and then you sell them again, you know, 6 weeks in, four weeks in, whatever, for the next deal. Credit a 5K uh for the for the setup that they don't have to do and then they can pay for that. That's option one.
(3:22:55) Option two is that you just say it's 15k and then after the first three months it continues at three grand a month or $3,500 a month. It just automatically continues. Now when you go in, you still want to sell them on it, but you don't need to actually have them do anything transaction-wise. So it's like they just say yes and you say awesome. Well, you're already squared away. We just want to make sure tell you what the next steps are looking like and this is where we're going from here.
(3:23:14) Got it. Makes sense. So like I think you call it like what is it? Short tail, long distribution. Yeah. Big head, long tail. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Okay. What are your thoughts on um doing like rev shares or app splits or contracting the agents directly? Everything that we met at the school games and you were saying the brokerage is like 100% the play. Oh well then yeah the brokerage is the play.
(3:23:38) I mean like if you get if anybody who's listening to this like in general if you have a a legal way to actually split revenue with a business that is like and if you're mind you if you're good at what you do which if you listen to my stuff please be good at what you do.
(3:23:54) Um, that is always going to be the best way to because performance is always is the most lucrative for winners. I think there's a huge caveat on that one. Okay, then put your huge caveat on it. Well, I would just say like what are the results for getting people on the front end? Because like even if your offer is shitty in your sales, that was my caveat. You got to be good. I'm asking. Okay. Like that's what I'm curious of is like what are the results? I was trying to say like I didn't I was like I said this. No, I know.
(3:24:12) But I'm I'm just I know you said it as a caveat, but I'm asking specifically right now because I mean we've seen it in in our businesses and our portfolio companies, which is if you're good enough on the front end, you can have a shitty sales team, a shitty CSS team, a shitty offer, and people just keep wanting to pay you sales because you're really good on the front end for getting them the results.
(3:24:29) So, I'm just trying to understand if is it an expectations issue or a procedural issue? Are you asking if if we're getting people results just so I'm clear on the question? Yes. What's the average results? Yeah, correct. Um, well, honestly to like to be clear, I have a hard time getting people to report the results back to us. That's been like a big bottleneck for us, I would say, on that.
(3:24:47) Um, but the clients who are crushing it are like really crushing it. Like we had one girl who just came in um on her first appointment, she found someone who was going to roll over like $4 million in annuities. Uh we get we get people that close like six figure Yeah. insurance policies all the time.
(3:25:06) So, let me let me tell you what Ila the first thing that Ila wrote down when you said your the name of your business or what you do. She wrote down price and then she wrote down avatar. And so, right now there's two elements that you need to control. Right? So, if like what I hear from you is right now is that you have volatility in your results.
(3:25:23) You have some that are super good and some that are nothing. Right? And from the perspective that all outcomes flow from you which you should take that you know ownership on life then you need to pick either better customers or number two you need to train them better or a combination of both. And so maybe there's a client that you're getting that is a certain type of avatar of insurance agent that this thing is worth $50,000 for and those people all succeed rather than trying to find the blended average of zeros and 100. Does that make sense?
(3:25:55) Yeah. So, you're saying like maybe decreasing units in just a top. Yes. Yes. Yes. So, I'll I'll tell you a story. I'll tell you a story that'll reinforce this. So, you gave the analogy with Gym Launch. So, I just want to make sure that you remember this one point before I say that, which is that you need you need LTV to be over if you really like you want to hit a million dollars a month, you need LTV be at 20 or 25,000 minimum in order to get there.
(3:26:18) All right. That's what gets you there. So, anybody who's watching, it's sales velocity times lifetime value equals hypothetical max. So, if you're curious like how that works, um it's SV times um Hmax. Um and so this equals your hypothetic max. You're like, hey, I So, if you want to reverse engineer a goal, you say, what's the revenue goal I want to hit? You say, cool.
(3:26:42) Well, I'm doing this many deals a month, which means this is how much I have to have every deal be worth over the lifetime in order to get this revenue eventually. Okay, back to you. So, so Leela is suggesting that you do 25K for 3 months instead of 15. We've seen we've tested this in multiple businesses where essentially it's literally the exact price increase actually which is you go from 15 to 25K there's barely a difference in terms of conversion as long as we're just we're qualifying a little bit more on the front end. So maybe you lose I think it's like the average business we've lost like 2 or 3% barely any on
(3:27:13) conversion but we've increased the price by $10,000 and so like I actually think you get the 25k on the front end if you just qualify your clients more heavily and just be okay with cat going up. So if cat goes from 3500 to 5k who cares because the thing is is that those people are going to stick and that's ultimately going to make your business way more valuable.
(3:27:33) The biggest issue that we see with agencies because we not only built a software for agencies, we've there's tons that come through the door is just they're so scarcely minded that they will not dial in the avatar and it seems contra like contradictive to what you're trying to do. But it will absolutely result in you get two things from that, right? One, you're going to get better talent because you have better clients.
(3:27:50) Yeah. Huge. The better clients that you have, the better talent you're going to get. And that's one of the hardest things for an agency to scale is that a lot of people don't want to work for an agency. It's a commodity. There's so many agencies out there.
(3:28:02) And so what makes yours different? And the worst thing for good talent is shitty clients. You know, when I was uh hiring, for example, for acquisition.com in the beginning, I asked every single person I brought on for the portfolio, what's your biggest fear and what would make you quit? And every single one of them said, "If we bring on shitty partnersh and so in order for you to have to reach the revenue goals that you want, I really feel confident that if you raised your price, you had better clients. You're going to be able to get better talent. They're not going to leave. and
(3:28:26) it's going to make the business in the short term it might feel like oh gosh do we have some refiguring out to do but I think in the long term you'll make way more money and it'll be a better business to own you're going to like it more so let me tell you one of the breakthroughs that we had with gym launch in the very beginning um obviously like a personal trainer could conceivably use what gym launch taught right and what Gym Launch licensed could they could there's no there's nothing that really stops a personal trainer from using it the problem is that they're just not ready they're just not that level they're just not you I mean,
(3:28:56) they're not they're not responsible enough. They haven't learned the meta skills. They're like, "Why aren't you working my leads for me?" Right. Yeah. Just like the I can't make a sale. That sounds so familiar. I can't make sales. This is your problem. Right. And so, what's interesting is that everybody who competed against me, so this is like I really want you to like like take this to heart.
(3:29:13) Everyone who competed against me in the in the in the gym space and I will just say the fitness space couldn't say no to money. And as a result, their brands were diluted because they had so many people who didn't get results. And it might not have been because of anything they did, but because of a strategic decision they did to choose to take bad customers.
(3:29:33) And so instead, we just said if you like we figured out because just like you, you have like a couple people who are doing well, right? So we looked at our top 20% of customers and we said what do these people have in common in terms of the behaviors they do and the people they are in terms of the like demographics and like quantitative facts about their business that are objective.
(3:29:52) So we figured out that it was a a it must be a gym owner, number one. Number two, they must have a signed lease. Number two, number three, they have to have at least one employee. And number uh number four, they have to have at least 30 members. Yeah. And if they had those four things, then they would have a very high likelihood of being successful.
(3:30:10) And so that became our qualification inside of our funnel, inside of our application, inside of the copy of our ads, inside of our landing pages. We repeated everywhere. It was the first thing we said on sales calls. And by doing that, the right person's like, "Oh yeah, perfect. I meet all of these requirements. This is for me.
(3:30:21) " And to the same degree, people who are not that are like, "Oh, this isn't for me." And so it actually didn't really increase our CAC that significantly, but it dramatically enhanced the LTV of each customer.
(3:30:35) And this is why like I I've told a story in I think one of the other books, maybe I told in the money's book, but there was a there was a there was a guy that I helped who was in the same space in fitness and he also sold uh personal traders and stuff. He was doing the same sales velocity as me, same number of sales per month, but his LTV was like 7K. Our LTV was 42. And because of that, we were making like 300 times the profit. That's the game. Okay, got it.
(3:31:00) So, just I mean that's interesting you say that because we've done that over the last year and it's just gotten better and better and better every time we do that. So, here's kind of the the thing I'm trying to balance is because like I I don't want to stop at a million a month. Like I mean I know you're a huge fan of the insurance industry and there's like there's a lot of room that you can go here. Yeah.
(3:31:17) Um so it's like I view the marketing agency like it seems like in this industry no one has the skill of marketing. Yeah. So, I think this is a good launch pad to kind of get into something even bigger. Yeah. So, what I'm trying to figure out is what that flight is. So, let me just tell you what, let me go ahead. You got to you got to do this to do that. All right.
(3:31:33) So, don't uh don't try and cure cancer before you uh like figure out how to do like test tubes and, you know, do do things in our microscope. So, the point is this. If you can figure out who the right agents are and what the quantitative metrics are, that will then inform if you want to do M&A and do partnerships down the road because you need to have way better predictive skill is who's a winner and who's not for you to even think about getting into that.
(3:31:57) And so you got to do this first either way. It's step one regardless. So that should give you a lot of like big exhale. You're not doing the wrong thing. You're doing the first thing. Okay. Would you because we're spending like almost 200 grand or over 200 grand a month on ads. Yeah, dude.
(3:32:15) Like if we need less volume, you think we do less ad spend more like cold outreach kind of stuff? No, I think you should still spend the same money. You just need to be very clear in your ads who it's for. Okay. Yeah. Just call out the avatar in the ads. Yes.
(3:32:31) That plus the price plus maybe you add in, you know, a VSSL or something like that before they book a call if you already have one. If you don't already have one, then I think like that alone will make the biggest difference. It's just the messaging. Yeah. Got it. So, I just need to do 8020 on the clients. Yes. Dial in. Yes. Yeah.
(3:32:48) When it comes to an agency, it's just like the hard high churn just does not scale. It it breaks at some point. Whether it breaks because your talent flywheel doesn't spin or because the client flywheel doesn't spin. One or both of them honestly break. I'll tell you right now, I have yet to see an SMB agency crack 10 million. And I've seen a lot of agencies. Most agencies get stuck at 1 to three.
(3:33:07) Sometimes they get to five, maybe seven, right? But the reason is that churn, churn is too high. So they just become these churn factories and CAC continues to go up and they never get any kind of compounding. And so then a new agency comes in and then just scoops up lower CAC and then eventually their CAT gets high as the reputation catch up. And that's like the spin cycle that everyone goes on.
(3:33:23) The only way to break free of that is you do one of two strategies in agencies. Number one is that you actually actively decide to be strategically lowpriced. So you say, "I'm going to organize the entire business with VAS and AI and automation so that I can provide basically a low price commoditized service of lead genen or whatever it is for 300, $500 a month." And then believe it or not, you can get 38month 40month stick rates.
(3:33:47) Super low 2% 3% churn for those types of customers because they're like, I know I should market, but I don't want to do it and these guys do good enough. Right. Right. Or you say, I'm gonna go up market because I'm gonna go to a legitimate business because the middle ground is where everyone lives and everyone in the middle there wants somebody who's going to be their savior. They want them to do this. I want you to do the sales for me.
(3:34:12) I want you to lead nurture for me. I want you to do everything for me and just send me money in the mail. It's not going to happen. Only the experienced business owners get that. That's not going to happen. or you actually price so that you have the gross margins in a very very very scalable, very lowcost version of this.
(3:34:28) Um that you can you can price it at a place where it's like they know they're not going to because the for them $2,500 a month $3,000 a month is everything. It's so much money, right? So 500 a month is what it feels like for a legit business to spend five or 10,000 a month, right? Heard rock and roll. Awesome. Appreciate you, man. Thank you, dude. Thank you for donating books. Absolutely. All right. All right. See you.
(3:34:53) Was that fun for you guys? So, some of the things that we talked about are actually heavily in the LTV uh playbook. So, that process that we talked about in terms of reverse engineering um client so that you can maximize LTV. That's just one of the plays.
(3:35:10) It's like I only have three bullets to explain because you don't want to uh you don't want to put like let me tell you every single thing that's in every playbook. It would just overwhelm people. So, that's one of the processes that we run uh in order to uh increase LTV for for for a business. All right. What do we got next? Oops. No, you called somebody. No, I did, Jimmy. But I didn't look at his stats.
(3:35:30) Oh, what's wrong with this phone? Oh, I think the phone died. Oh, no, it didn't. Here we go. Hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's up? Rock and roll. I'm watching on YouTube. So, all right. What's up, Jimmy Le? So 1.9 million. You're a law firm. Yes. Okay. All right. What's margin? Margin is only at 7%. Okay. We might have a pricing issue.
(3:35:55) What's going on here? Well, uh I mean I guess I doing quite a bit of So we're kind of a general service law firm. Okay. Covering five different practice area, personal injury, criminal defense. So we cover quite a bit. We have seven other attorneys doing all all the various and I guess that's probably why maybe the profit margin might be low in the beginning because we're kind of aggressively growing and adding people. You got seven attorneys, dude.
(3:36:22) So I started the business um uh you know I had to start a business to stay in the US because I'm unfortunately from Taiwan. Okay. And so kind of regressively growing and all these different channels and profit centers we call it and then um just grow to about 23 full-time part-time employees. Dude, that's insane. Revenue to employee ratio is probably not ideal.
(3:36:46) No. And that the reason that you have so many is because you essentially have they're saying yeah because you have so many services that you're providing. Correct. Yes. I'm guessing right now, how like before I before we get into this, why do you have how are you getting customers right now? I'm guessing it's all via referral, but tell me tell me I'm wrong. Uh no, we have Google ads.
(3:37:11) Um I would say 50% is um organic. We have really great Google Maps ranking. So we get about 20 to 40 phone calls each day. Um and yeah, I think I've always been told to niche down, but I'm the person that couldn't focus. I uh I don't want to put all eggs in one basket, so I'm doing all all the different contrary to traditional advice, you know, you can't put all the eggs in one basket, then you drop all the baskets. Yeah. So Dale Carnegie's advice is put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.
(3:37:41) So you I mean you're in the swamp. You're 1 to three million. It's a very classic spot and you need to niche down. I actually cover this in the scaling road map. Um you need to niche down because you're not getting any efficiencies. You're you're basically having to rederive solutions for every single person, right? Yeah, especially with and I'm going to bet you right now that operationally, and this isn't me, I'm not throwing shade. I just want to be clear. I get it.
(3:38:05) Things are kind of tough right now. Um, I think you probably need more operational discipline. Yes. Yeah. Right. And so, like, I'll say this. Do you have do you have more demand than you can handle or do you have a lot of excess capacity right now? We probably have 30% more capacity. All right. That's not good. So that because like let's say we actually maxed you out, you're not going to get like your incremental margin is going to be tiny.
(3:38:35) Even if you got the extra 30%, you're still going to be running like 10% margins. It's going to be nothing, right? So we do have a little bit of a model and pricing issue. Number one, go ahead. I know you're Yeah. And I'm just curious like of the services rendered, what would you say take up the most amount of like what contribute to the most amount of revenue? personal injury, estate planning. Sure.
(3:38:59) Right now it's family block that contributes to about 50% of our revenue. Okay. Build the personal injury side. We just built that out three months ago and have signed up 20 coins since then. So just a small investment with personal injury the runway is typically 69 months before revenue. Yeah, dude. I think you need to est like let me let me say it this way.
(3:39:27) If I'm going to go get surgery, right? I'm not going to go to a generalist. I'm going to go to a knee surgeon or I'm going to go to a nose surgeon or I'm going to go to a back surgeon. If I'm going to get legal help for my estate, I'm going to go to somebody who specializ in estate. If I'm going to go to a personal injury, if I have a personal injury, I'm going to go to a personal injury specialist.
(3:39:44) And and the people who will go to a generalist are not the people who want to pay a lot. Mhm. because they weren't smart enough to figure that out. Okay. So, which of these different services do you run the highest gross margins on? That's something that I'll need to work on. Part of it is I need probably need to get a CFO on board or something.
(3:40:10) Let's ask this. How many attorneys do you have that focus on family law? Four. And then how many? And you have seven attorneys total. Yes. And then of your VAS that you have, uh, where what are they doing? Because you said you have 23 people. Yeah. So we have three on the sales team intaking people, um, and some support staff, uh, assistant work, parillegal.
(3:40:36) Okay. What would you say their split is about the same 50% focus on family law? Yeah, I I'll say that. Yeah. Okay. So, half of the firm essentially is family law. Just put the mic next to it so they they can hear it. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll say this, man. I I do think you're probably mispriced right off the bat.
(3:41:02) Like, you need like if you're a service based business owner, which is exactly what you are, you need to know your gross margins like the back of your hand. And in the business that you're in, I'd be like I this might this will shock you, but I like to have at least 80% gross margins in any service business that I run. Wow. Yes. Figure out. Yeah. I hope you can figure this out. Now part of Yeah. So you have like you have a packaging issue as part of this.
(3:41:26) Now one of the other issues is that you can choose to not bill hourly and you can just bill by solution. That is one way of doing things which aligns you with the customer and also allows you to drive down your cost as much as possible and aligns everyone's outcomes and especially with AI in your firm. Like I'm still surprised you have so many attorneys.
(3:41:43) Like if you're looking for the future, man, like AI is one of the like legal is one of the the biggest, you know, um businesses that's going that is actively getting disrupted. So, we need to we need to niche down number one. Number two, we need to pick the thing that has the highest potential for gross margins.
(3:42:02) Number three, I'd want to package this in such a way that I'm decoupled from hourly rates so that my team isn't like, well, they're making this. It's just like it's independent. We're operating these things independently. And then I want to make sure hardcore that I am auditing the time of my uh you know the subordinates the people who are actually running the legal side so that I can make sure that my revenue per headcount is going up like that's probably your north star.
(3:42:27) I have one question. Yeah. I have one question for you. You said that you had to build the business to stay in the United States. Do you come from a law background or a business owner background or neither? Neither. I just graduated law school I think three years ago and um I kind of had to start my own business with the with the visa to stay in the US.
(3:42:45) Got it. So you didn't before that you didn't did you study specifically family law or personal injury or just general law? No, just just law school, just general law. And myself, I I practice immigration myself. Um so that's the irony of we do do flat fees for immigration. Um is it profitable? Yeah. Yeah, it's profitable.
(3:43:09) Um and then we're trying to grow that out mostly doing Facebook ad strategy right now with immigration. Thank you. Hundred million dollar man. Let's go. Full attack mode. I think we heard you. Like if we zoom out and we're like what created this problem. Um I think part of it is that when you got into it, you hadn't had a business before and you hadn't practiced that that specific law before, right? And so you don't know what's normal, what's not, how many attorneys can handle how much.
(3:43:35) So this is completely normal. I just want to like put that out there. Like when we had our first business, we overhired and overshot by a lot. And it was painful to fix that because essentially we didn't know. We're like, I don't know how many tickets can a support rep take? How many like how long does it take one staff accountant to do the books? How many calls can a sales rep take? Like I don't know. I've not built this before. And so I think that's really normal.
(3:43:57) And especially if you haven't done those things yourself, you don't have your personal experience to call upon. And so it makes sense that this occurred. Um and I think that for you in order to get out of the situation we have to solve the original problem which is understanding that we have to we kind of have to go backwards from that. Right.
(3:44:17) Right. Right. So I think just in general putting it out there it's normal. So for everyone watching like very normal for this to happen. We talked about this yesterday on the live stream as well which is like there's so many times in business where you start something and then you get into this situation and then it feels like I want to double down on this.
(3:44:34) So, it's like, no, I've already invested in having personal injury, in having the family law, and having the immigration. And so, the worst thing that you can do when you make a mistake or a misstep is to double down on it. We don't want to double down on mistakes or on sunk costs. We instead want to pull out of it.
(3:44:51) And so, I think this is one of those situations where the instinct is always going to be, I want to double down because you're like, crap, that sounds like a lot of work to undo it. But, I think like you are 12 months away from a much more profitable, less of a headache business.
(3:45:03) And there's probably one or two attorneys that you could probably let go right now and I'll bet you the other ones if with a little bit of AI and a little bit of training could probably absorb that workload. I would also strongly question because you haven't quantified anything like you made an estimate that you could have an increase of 30% in utilization before you hit capacity. I would bet and this is not me you know doing this as a slight just because it's your first run you probably have two to three times the capacity with that existing team.
(3:45:22) You just don't know how to you don't know how to utilize it which is why the margins are what they are. Right. True. Yeah. So, I need to do more homework and I'm I'm glad uh yeah, I'll need to a lot a lot to do before u trying to trying to reach my ultimate goal. Thank you. No, you bet, man. Thank you, dude. And good luck. Ju just know this, man.
(3:45:41) It like this is the ignorance debt, man. Like, this is like it's painful, but when you look back in 24 months, you're like, "Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't even know that." I didn't even quantify Yeah. I didn't quantify utilization. We weren't even tracking their hours. like we didn't have them allocated and we didn't have all these services templatized so we could immediately two or 3x the the throughput per attorney like there's all these things right and you just aren't doing it yet and so I would encourage you to do this do not keep trying to grow your
(3:46:04) top line I would want you to focus entirely on growing your bottom line how do I increase the margin from seven to 40 if you don't have enough profit you can't hire the best attorneys and if you can't hire the best attorneys you don't have high paying clients if you don't have high paying clients you don't have good margins so it's just a round and around circle chicken or the egg problem vic vicious cycle or virtuous cycle. So, you just need to you need to stop the the buck stops now and then you need to flip how you're
(3:46:27) thinking through the business from unit economics up. Yeah, you're right. I think I've been just been that was so great. I've been just focused on the top line instead of like looking at the bottom line. It's kind of like vanity metrics, you know what I mean? People like, oh, look at how many followers I have and but then their f followers won't buy anything that they have, right? It's the same with revenue. It's like vanity metrics. It's like instead if you were at the same revenue a year from now, but
(3:46:50) you had double the profit margin, would you be satisfied? Cool. Rock and roll, man. Appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for donating books, man. Appreciate you. Yeah. Come on. Donate. Congrats. Thank you. See you. All right. All right. We got another one. See what [Music] Charles Bradshaw. All right. Abyss Gaming. It's gaming and SAS.
(3:47:22) They are pre-revenue. Let's hit it. And we're gonna go. All right. Gaming and SAS. Oh, pre-revenue. Okay. [Music] Oh, this sounds like a All right, Charles. What's up, Charles? How's it going? Um, so I'm working on a a video game and I've got zero revenue because takes forever to build. Yeah.
(3:47:50) Um, but I I wanted to get your thoughts on two revenue moves that that might affect me in the future. Okay. Um, so so for a little more context, I think I'll get about 500k revenue in the next two years. Uh, selling 25k units with uh $30 per unit and then the platform takes about 30% cut. So it be about $21. Is this Steam or what platform you doing on? Yeah, Steam. Okay, got it.
(3:48:14) Um, so the the the first belief that I have is that it's very difficult to get customers to spend way more. Uh, I don't know how I could do what you did where like you're selling $30 books and like multi,000 upselles. Um, right now my plan is like offer a fourpack bundle and extra content or art for as an add-on. I wondered if you feel like I'm missing anything obvious as a higher ticket option.
(3:48:39) So the first thing that I would do is I would look at um some of the you know like the League of Legends like some of the big games that have existed for a long time and look at how they're they're basically their their money models. So whenever I enter a new space I look at all of the biggest players in the space money models and then I think okay of these and usually they're fully built out and you're not going to you don't like what you don't want to do is say oh they have this money model therefore I will mimic that 100%. that took them years to get to. But I will
(3:49:04) look at, okay, of these, which one has the highest contribution margin and which of them can I most easily replicate and then just go focus hardcore on this one thing. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I think because the software is going to take all I won't be able to do the same money models, but I I think that that principle applies well.
(3:49:21) That's how I think if I'm going to a brand new market that I don't know anything about, that's where I start. And if I'm using my meta concepts like like when I think about you from a utility perspective, most monetization is going to come from speed, risk or um or ease, right? But in the game that you're playing, a lot of it is going to come from status and entertainment.
(3:49:43) And so most of the things that you're going to sell are going to be how can I have more status? How can I have more entertainment? Now status is going to be in some ways like skins and things like that. But there's also like tools, you know, weapons, etc. like upgrade. I'm just using this figuratively speaking, right? Um those are the things that I think um ultimately drive the most.
(3:50:00) But again, at the end of the day, the game has to be exceptional. If the game's exceptional, then long-term it never matters. Um because that's the only thing that matters in the big picture. Okay. So, what I'm hearing is that for games, you don't think the back end matters as much and value and virality more. Yes.
(3:50:18) For because in in the game business, think about like this. In the game business, you can either win on LTV or you can win on low cac and almost every major game that exists in software, they win on low cac. Like enterprise B2B SAS, Salesforce, they won because of ex insane LTV, right? So, it's not like Salesforce is viral. They're just so expensive and they can spend so much money to acquire customers. That's why that business worked.
(3:50:45) But for a low ticket business, right, you're going to win on low CAC, which has to be word of mouth, which only comes from being really, really good and having people talk about it. That makes sense. That brings me to my second potentially limiting belief. Um, do you think that I can um possible to profit from direct response ads if I'm only getting Is it possible? Yes.
(3:51:06) But what will happen is that you will slowly well okay let me like let me see if I'm going to draw this so everybody else who's at home can see this. So fine you want to put yeah put him there. There we go. So in the beginning let's say like day one you run ads and you you know let's say you actually figure out a way to make it profitable right? So you've got you know your cost and then you've got your revenue and that seems like you're like okay cool this is working. The thing is is that as you go to colder colder traffic to people who are less and less likely to convert, what's going to
(3:51:37) happen is that this cost basis is just going to keep increasing until eventually you reach this point. And so the scale of your business is going to be dictated by how cheaply you can acquire customers. And so the like all of this if you're looking if you're on the live stream is the only excess kind of gross profit you're going to be able to realize in the business and then quickly you'll cap out.
(3:52:04) And so the long-term play, especially in a high volume game type software, is going to be on word of mouth virality, which is why it is to your point a winner or take all market if you are really good. Otherwise, you kind of play these onesie twoosies. You maybe you saturate a couple tiny markets, some players that really like it. Maybe you do like a gorilla marketing on on Reddit forums and you school communities that are into games, whatever.
(3:52:24) Um, and that is a way, but the whole point of if you're going to run ads in the beginning is you want to run ads to get the customers in so you can learn their behavior so you can improve the game. I was going to say, do we even want to think about an upsell right now? No, that's like the core the core engine has to be exceptional. That's the main game right now. Pun intended. That makes sense.
(3:52:41) Uh, can I ask what's your like rule of thumb for like how much profit margin per customer do you need before it makes sense to start doing ads? Well, I mean, you should have I mean, your incremental margin should be really high, right? Maybe I use the wrong term, but like like would you expect to make $40 per um like per purchase before you run an ad? Like obviously you wouldn't run an ad for $1 purchase price.
(3:53:08) You're saying what should you price your soft rod in order to run ads to be profitable? Uh, no. I'm asking a very general like at what dollar of profit per unit would you consider running ads at? It wouldn't be an absolute profit per unit, it would be a percentage. Okay.
(3:53:31) And fundamentally, if you can if you can acquire customers at break even or better and then you still have more things to sell, that's the point of a money model, right? Okay. So, if you get customers for free, then everything else is juice. Sounds good. Yeah. Uh, that's all the questions I have. I just want to say that I love the work that you're doing and I really appreciate it. Thank you, man. I appreciate that, dude. Have a good one. You too. You too.

(3:54:45) 250K. Yeah. Okay. What was it? Digital spotlight. What? Yeah. I don't know what that means. We'll find out. This is decent. Decent sound. I have no idea. I'm just watching to see if they they Yeah. Y'all are great, by the way. Damn, we're getting ghosted. I know. You've reached Ash's voice. Thank you. This is such a J. Please record your message.
(3:55:26) When you finish recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Ash was his name. Go for it. Bye. What? Well, they pulled somebody out actually. They said not to. And so I think it was the wrong Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wrong one. I replied to that one. said uh they pulled out. Oh, they pulled out. Mhm. Oh, wow. All right, let's go. That's That's okay. Uh John, marketing. All right. Marketing revenue 1.1 million.
(3:55:51) Profit 130K. Okay. All right, John. 1.1. John, I don't want to get ghosted again. Yeah. Feel like I'm in high school again making prank calls. Dude, where's the uh Hey, can you hear us? Hey, can you hear me? Yes, sir. Yeah. Awesome. Thanks for not ghosting. My pleasure. So, uh, tell us what's the constraint in the business? What's, um, preventing you from growing right now? Uh, great question. Let me pull up my notes.
(3:56:29) Um, so, uh, I help brands on Amazon, you know, gets their get their products seen, sold, and loved by customers. Um, right now we're primarily working with uh brands that are doing anywhere from 100,000 to 2 million uh a year on Amazon. Oo, small. Yeah.
(3:56:46) And so they're really getting squeezed by, you know, rising ad costs, tariffs, Amazon fees, and then of course, you know, slow cash flow that comes with uh an inventory business. So, I guess my question is if you were in my shoes, how would you help these brands um again who primarily sell on Amazon solve this problem? Ideally in 6 weeks or less. All right. Ideally in six weeks or less. Wow.
(3:57:07) We got we got a big big timeline here. Alex looks excited right now. Yeah, I'm pumped. He's got a great idea. Yeah. No, so basically you've got you got two options, man. And I like I don't know about your six week timeline. That's irrelevant to me. But you have you have two options in terms of the strategy of this business right now. You have a you have a bottom feeder.
(3:57:24) You're you're you're doing with like barely entrepreneurs, right? And again, this is everybody's listening to this. 2 million a year for physical products versus two million a year for for services. Wildly different. All right? Because they have cost of goods. There's there's always cash flow issues. They've got supply chain.
(3:57:41) There's all the other problems, right? And then obviously if there especially with Amazon, it's like they also have platform fees on top. So it can be a pain. All right? So I just want to like put that out there. Now, that being said, I would say that if you're if you want if you want to stay in this business, I would say either if you're going to serve that avatar specifically, you're going to have to figure out the most automated, the most scalable solution.
(3:58:02) Otherwise, you will create a churn factory that like basically your churn will be indicative of their volatility of the volatility of their businesses. So, their volatility will reflect in the volatility of your business. And so you have to price in such a way that they that even with their volatility, you have to basically price to their worst month, not their best month. Does that make sense? Yeah.
(3:58:24) Yeah. And I think that and I don't want to make you repeat yourself because I know you talked to another agency already about that situation. Um so I guess my next question then is is that um if we did go with, you know, kind of that proumer um if you will, um how would you do that from an upfront offer? Like would you do something like you guys did with Gym Launch where you have well I guess Gym Launch probably isn't that good of an example but um where you have an offer of $1,000 or $3,000 upfront and then move them into a monthly fee of Yes. you know 300 bucks. Yes.
(3:58:56) So I would 100% do that. And there's there's two options too, right? So this is a wave fee offer structure which is the I don't know what chapter is in the book but it's the last one in continuity. So, uh, the way that I would position the offer is, hey, um, and this is again, if you think that these people are worthy of like keeping their commitments, I'm going to guess as a proumer, they're just not. So, let's just go ahead and just nyx that.
(3:59:20) So, it's going to be $3,000 upfront, one time, and then it's, you know, pay as you go, you know, 300 bucks a month or you might be, can you control the processing flow or the income flow? If you can, then you'd want to do a percentage there. If not, then yeah, 300, you know, not really. Yeah. Then, yeah, 300 to 500 a month is where you're going to want to be.
(3:59:38) Uh, and then I would say you could probably get away with maybe even 5,000 up front, but it probably like I'm going to bet 5,000, five or six, and then 3 to 500 a month uh will be pretty good for that type of avatar. Okay? And it's a one-time setup. And then after that, obviously, the maintenance of the account should be significantly lower.
(4:00:03) And so your gross margins on the recurring should still be very strong despite it being significantly lower cost. And the upfront is really just to offset cost of acquisition, right? So what would that um what would you recommend as far as that transition from the upfront offer into the continuity to make it as successful as possible? Well, they're sold together. They're sold together.
(4:00:21) Okay. So it's $300 a month, $400 a month. It's $5,000 one time up front of setup fee. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Anything else that you haven't talked about uh so far that's would be important to know for this kind of Yeah. If you want if you want you can add in a second tier of service. Now you could just peel apart your existing thing into two two quote tiers.
(4:00:49) Give the second tier for free as long as they do XYZ just to make sure that they get activated. So that is an option because at the end of the day like you have to get them activated. You have to get them on board. You have to do all those things.
(4:01:03) So what are the things that can maximize the likelihood that it happens which is either carrot or stick or both? Tell me a little bit more. I I don't think I fully understand. A a stick would be uh we'll charge you a fine, right? A carrot would be we'll give you a discount, right? Or we'll give you more of this good stuff for free if you do XYZ. Okay.
(4:01:21) So just hypothetically, would that look like? Okay, let's say it's a $5,000 upfront and maybe we give you $1,000 discount if you do this in your account and set up this and do that. Yes. So, I'll give you an example of how this would work. So, let's say that they pay 5,000 up front and you say, "But it's you'll get a $1,000 rebate as soon as you do this thing that activates a user.
(4:01:41) " Right? Now, that $1,000, you don't have to pay it all up front because then you're going to eat three months of cash flow, which you don't want to do, right? So then you take that thousand and you spread it over 12. And so really all you're doing is decreasing by $83 a month. And so you'd say, "Hey, our price is actually $3.
(4:01:59) 83 a month and it's 5,000 down, but you get $1,000 rebate if you activate." And then when they activate, you take that that $1,000, you spread the the 83 across all 12 months, drop 83 down to 300, and then you magically make it be 5,000 up front and then $300 a month. Now you put incentives like this is a money model. This is how it works.
(4:02:19) Perfect. Sounds like I just need to get to work. No, dude. Congrats. I mean, cool that you have business though, man. That's awesome. Yeah, I appreciate that. And thank you for all you guys do. No, you bet. Thanks for calling in. Appreciate it. Have a good Sunday. Yep. Donate some books. All right. Who we who who we want next. All right. We've got Hunter Finn. Okay.
(4:02:42) His business is Pet Method Animal Hospital. Okay. Love me some animal hospitals. Revenue 1 million. Profit 22% after a $100,000 salary. Okay. Okay. Animal hospitals really is super M&A heavy. What's wrong with this phone? There's nothing wrong. It's just cuz it's blocking the the top. Oh, what? It's failing. Let's try one more time. Maybe he gave us a prank number. All right. There we go. There we go. Boom. All right.
(4:03:13) I feel like we get to be in this together. Hello. What's up, Hunter? Hey, how's it going? It's good. I I wasn't going to go straw, so I appreciate that. We appreciate that. I feel ever so lucky. Well, I appreciate you helping me. So, no, we appreciate you, dude. Um, so tell us the animal hospital right now.
(4:03:36) My my curiosity is what's the goal with it right now? Do you want to scale it? Do you want to get more money per location? Do you want to just make this location run on its own so that you can, you know, be with your family? Like, what's your goal with the business? Yeah, I mean, so I'm a little younger. I mean, I'm only 32, so like I figured I'm going to do this for a long time.
(4:03:58) Um, ideally, I would like to have more family time, but right now, like, I'm actually kind of bored at the clinic. Like, we need a lot more patients to be seen. Um, and I would I'd like to help. By patients, you mean animals, right? Yeah. So, my animals. Yeah.
(4:04:14) So, I'd like to help the most amount of patients that I can while also making the most amount of money. Okay. And so, again, can you repeat your revenue and profit? 1 million. Yeah. So, th So, this year we'll be at 1 million. Um, last year we were at 700,000. The year before that was $4.99. So, we're growing. We're growing, but I feel like the jump this year has mostly just been due to my price increases more so than like actual new patients coming in.
(4:04:46) And what's uh where where you where do you reside? Where's your business located? Um we're north of Dallas in uh McKini, Texas. Okay, that's a good location. Yeah, there's a lot of people. Tons of people. Tons of uh as well. Tons of bets. Lots of bets. Okay. So, what did you do the years prior from essentially right now you want to see how do I grow faster and not be bored? I I wanna I want to feel a little bit more fulfilled like we're you know I'm making you know a good amount of money more than it is an associate but I want to do more. I want to build something very special. I want to help uh pets.
(4:05:15) I mean honestly I've always wanted to nationwide but I figured out how hard this was with my single location. So I kind of scaled back my vision a little bit after that. Oh let's not do that. Yeah. This is just a step, man. You're already Yeah. You've already got, you've already put all the years into this. Like, I don't think that's unreasonable.
(4:05:32) Yeah. Um, so I, you know, whatever path would help me help more pets and again, obviously be a little bit better off financially and spend time with my family is where I want to go. But I'm fine, you know, sticking to it, seeing as many pets as I can myself, um, to not put myself in a bad spot to set that up for success. Okay. Okay. So, I have a couple questions.
(4:05:59) One, are you the primary you call caregiver? Yes. So, I'm the only doctor. I have one receptionist and two technicians. And then how many days per week hours are you working? How many patients are you seeing? Um, so we see on average about 16 patients a day. Um, and that's Monday through Friday. Fridays are half days right now. Okay.
(4:06:18) So, how many hours do you work a day? Uh, it's it comes out to about 36, maybe 40. Okay. Um, next question. How Okay, so you have 16 patients per day. And then how do you get those patients? Most like well over 60% of it is absolutely referral, just word of mouth. People seem to be really happy with us, which is great.
(4:06:43) It just seems to like take a while for those people to come in unless they have an issue or they, you know, they get a reminder that they're due for something and then they remember us. M well how actively are you like how what kind of um cadence are you basically nurturing them on to like do you have them on a maintenance plan right now? So there there's no like membership plan.
(4:07:07) It's basically kind of like pay as you go. So, they come in, they pay they pay a consult fee, but we do have like reminders for core things like vaccines, uh, fecals, blood work, if their cat has like kidney disease, like reminders to come in for those checkups, but they're only sent out um two months before it's due.
(4:07:28) Um, two weeks before, and then like two weeks after they've missed their appointment. That's all we do. I like that. All right. We have a plan. So, so there's a there's the 101 version and there's the 2011 version, right? So, the 101 version is something that we call BAMF fam.
(4:07:47) All right? Which is book a meeting from a meeting, which that no one ever leaves without booking a meeting. So, let's say they're, you know, they they their kidney got fixed today. Great. Well, we're going to want to book the next meeting for 3 months from now or six months from now. So, you just look at the p the patient or the pet and you look at their file and you see which one of the next things that's due and then you just book that meeting. That is the requirement.
(4:08:05) Okay, that's how it works. As simple as simple as that. Literally, no one leaves without already knowing when they're coming back. Okay, we can do that. Done. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we literally don't do that at all. We just I kind of I That'll probably double your business. I'm not even jo like that alone.
(4:08:22) Yeah. No, we don't we don't I just started sending like emails to our existing clients. I mean, we have about 2,000 clients right now, and I don't I don't do any I don't nurture them. They just kind of come in, and that's how we make our money.
(4:08:40) So, is it primarily like you and the receptionists that run the business? Um, yeah. I mean, really, yeah, the texts just kind of help me go room to room. Um, but then, I mean, we all kind of answer phones. Like, I'm still answering phones to be honest. Um, but yeah, it's mostly just us. I mean, I think the first focus is the profitability piece, getting more of them, coming back in and rebooking.
(4:09:01) I think the second piece is having the right people so that you could scale it in the future if you want to. But you would have to first get yourself out of this location, out of this location. Well, how are we? So, we increase cash flow, right? Increase cash flow.
(4:09:17) And then we say, okay, how do we bring in another practitioner? And then after that, we say, okay, if we can get ourselves out of this one, we can scale others. Okay, real quick. How much um how at capacity are you right now using all the pets? Oh, I mean I I could easily do 1.5 myself. If not, I mean I'm going to be a little you know I probably closer to 1.8 million I would say myself.
(4:09:40) But why are the margins so low? Um I'll be honest with you, they were even worse last year. This is all from me increasing my prices. What's the cost? Like what are the costs? You have a secretary and you've got a you got an office. Yeah, I mean my rent seems to be a little high, but it's not like killing us. What's your rent? Um we spend it's $8,500 a month.
(4:10:05) I mean it's a little high, but okay, fine. But like but but that's not that's not eating up for your staff. Uh so each staff member gets between 20 to $23 an hour. Okay. Well, then where's the cost coming from? That's a I mean the other 40% clients that aren't referral, are you paying to get those ones? Yeah. Well, I am, but those I only spend $4,000 a month on ads right now.
(4:10:29) And where's the money going? Uh, I mean, we have we we have um profit. I mean, we have around, you know, if I pay myself a h 100,000, we have around 200,000 left over. I just I don't do anything with it. I don't know what to do with it. Okay. But you're running 30% margins figuratively, right? If we added in your owner pay. Yeah. Yeah. Still seems a little low.
(4:10:55) Okay. Given there's no like you're the one doing the service. That's the thing. What's I think the pricing is what we said you raised it already, but probably need to raise it again. Yeah. What What did you raise it from too? I I raised it. So like let's say you know my exams I really didn't raise. My exams are $95.
(4:11:15) Um, but most of my other costs I raised them close to 100%. And no one cared. No one said anything. So that tells me it probably I'm probably still too low. Yep. Have you But our our average our average transaction like each each transaction is about 250. Yeah. So let me let me just give you this. So have you read Did you get my uh that email? It was a Mosy Minute email where I talked about pricing versus close rates.
(4:11:38) Yes. So I'm guessing your close rates are basically 100%. They're they're pretty good. Yeah. Right. So you like and you probably saw that if you're over 80% you've got like a triple. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean you you saw you saw a double and nothing changed.
(4:11:54) So that like that pricing guide is pretty accurate rule of thumb. And if you also doubled and still saw no change then the double still double or triple still remains. So, you might be able to get to $250, you know, sorry, uh to to to $500, $600 per and you still probably have room there because right now we fix so like in order of operations, it's like let's fix pricing even though you didn't fix it. It's like we need to increase pricing still with the increased pricing.
(4:12:19) We need to bring somebody else in to buy you time with the extra person and now added capacity. Then you need to start emailing your list on a regular basis. And from this point going forward, you institute Bam Fam as a way of life. No one leaves the office without knowing when they come back in. If you just do that, you're good. Okay, cool.
(4:12:36) Yeah. No, I like that plan. I'm I'm gonna sweat a little bit about the price increase again, but I'll do it because you told me to. Dude, the worst case they say no, man. I And that's what I expected everyone to say no last time and no one cared. No one cares, dude. It's their kids. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think you should worry about it.
(4:12:52) Also, McKenna, Texas is pretty good in terms of average income and such. It's on the higher end, so Yeah. Yeah. People I mean people spend what I consider a large amount of money on their pets which is great. You know it allows me to practice the gold standard which I like doing. I don't try to play the low cost game but maybe unintentionally I am a little bit lower cost.
(4:13:10) Like people do make comments that oh you're cheaper than so and so don't Yeah. You don't want to you don't want to be known for that. No I don't. No. You're in a service business man. Like service businesses especially with humans it's like you pretty much only have one play which is build a brand and continue to charge more. Like if you think about a meta concept of service businesses in general, your prices should really only go go one way.
(4:13:29) And you can measure how much you've succeeded as a service business by how high your prices are. Because if you succeed as a service business and you do a good job long enough, then you will always have more demand than you have supply. And if that is the case, then you continue to raise your price.
(4:13:46) And so that then reinforces the brand, which bring better people who spend more and you do a good job. You get a better reputation, which reinforces the brand. And so that's the virtuous brand and pricing loop. And so you can measure how advanced you are as a business owner by the prices you're able to charge because of how good you are at the service. Right. I feel like you're really good and it's just a literally a matter of like self-esteem. Totally. And confidence. Just charge more, man.
(4:14:04) No, it it is. I I struggle with it because I never want, you know, people to feel like I'm taking advantage. But like I I do consider us to be top quality. Like people love us. You're not taking advantage. You only go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. You take the money and then you invest it in getting better talent, better equipment. better training.
(4:14:22) Like we talked about this yesterday, me and Shiron, but like that's how the flywheel works. If you want to have a high quality business, you have to make a lot of profit because if you don't, then you can't invest to have that high quality business, right? And I and I and I do I have started to understand that the only way for me to help more pets and do what I want is to be profitable and continue to grow. Yes. If you want to go national, you need Yeah. You need to have Yeah. If you if and it's interesting because it's it's almost counterintuitive cuz like
(4:14:47) the people who really need to raise their prices the most are like your type of person. They're the usually the ones that are like the most hesitant. Yeah. It's the Lelayas, right? Like when I met Laya, I'll just say just so you feel a little better about this. Like this is totally learnable and this is this is a this is a perspective on the world.
(4:15:04) And when I met Ila, she was like, I just want everyone to be healthy. Because she was we were in fitness, right? She's like, I just want to help everyone. And I was like, don't you think you'd be able to help more people if you actually made a profit? And I would just say that our life is a living testimony of that.
(4:15:17) Yeah, absolutely. We couldn't make this content unless we had businesses that make money. We wouldn't have time. We wouldn't have the resources. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, I can do I can do all these things. Yeah, absolutely. Well, you got you have the four-part plan.
(4:15:36) We're going to increase prices with the extra cash flow, hire somebody with the extra time that you get back from that person. you're going to nurture the leads and put a basically the the fast cash uh playbook. We have the cash calendar system in there. That plus the LTV playbook will be the two things that I'd want you to focus on to install in the business as the first two things.
(4:15:54) And then after that um and bam fam is like you can do that tomorrow like that that's not like an opt like do that tomorrow. So those are the three actions and then bam fam is just like assumed. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No, I I can do that. I appreciate it. Rock and roll, dude. And the pricing uh the pricing playbook will help you just kind of with some of the messaging around how to raise the price. Cool. Yeah, I'm excited to get that.
(4:16:11) I appreciate it. You bet, man. Thank you for doing the hard work. I had uh 18 pets growing up, so I love animals. Yeah, that's crazy. I I have about 18 right now. You You and my wife would get along well. Great, man. I'm happy to hear it. All right, rock and roll. Thanks, man. Okay. Thank you for donating books.
(4:16:28) All right, see you. Byebye. Hash bringback Bill. I know. We had a cat named Bill. Freaked death. Very sad. Natasha paid like $1,000 to put him down. You know that. It's crazy. I'm like, man, you make 95 for an exam, pay $1,000 to put the cat down. Thank you for donating bucks. All right, Natasha. I thought this was for Natasha. No. Yeah. Natasha Green.
(4:16:56) What's up, Natasha? How are you? I'm amazing from the Boogie Down Bronx. Thanks for taking this call. No, you bet. Thank you. You're on Herozosi hotline. How can we help? Okay, so I have a mobile archery business in New York City where we bring archery to schools companies. We set up the archery range and we pop up.
(4:17:16) So in the past couple of years, I have seen an increase in revenue, but it's been staying around the same. So in 23, we made like 249 and 100 in bottom line in profit. And last year we made like 273 and 90 still like around profit. And then this year to date I did a lot better y'all. Awesome. We're around 297 with uh the same around 90 for a profit but I'm trying to get to a million. And so I would like to ask you a question on a strategy or something that's like been bugging us.
(4:17:48) Okay. If you don't mind. Go for it. So um a lot of schools share that they have a cap on their spending and it usually varies. So here in New York City, you know, each school is like their own business. They have their own like budget versus elsewhere, school districts have the higher level budget and it pushes down. And so last week, you know, I was pitching and I was using some of the techniques that you taught.
(4:18:10) And someone was like to my 30k offer, they were like, "Hey, no, um, we really only have 10K to work with." And so now it's sort of interesting. I'm trying to figure out, do I like sew good seeds? Do I like you know say hey let me work with this 10k but knowing that you know when more funding comes in through different grants or funding source for the schools they'll buy more but then do I hold the line and say let me hold that space for another like school but the vision and goal is to have more youth taking part in archery right Olympic archery it's
(4:18:44) fun it's healthy so that's where I'm at um and it's been exciting like I think we can make 500k uh this whole coming up by end of year, but I just feel like there's going to be points where there's push back because of, you know, schools have a certain budget. You want to take it? No, go for it. Yeah.
(4:19:14) So Natasha, one of the one of the really interesting things about like the more money you make, the more money you make is that in the beginning sometimes you have to artificially hold this line of supply and demand so that you can make higher margins. Now over time you're just demand increases and then you feel very confident in holding your line because you're like I don't really care. I have more demand than I can deal with.
(4:19:33) But in the beginning, you basically have to make this trade, which is why I think so many people kind of earn the right to continue to charge more over time because they do better and better. The demand goes up and supply stays fixed or goes down. And so then price rises, right? So if you feel confident that you're going to hit 500,000 and you you want to keep those prices because your margins are they're not I mean they're they're they're good, but they're not like, you know, insane, especially as a smaller business. Um I'm more inclined
(4:19:58) to try and say, how can we increase your flow? so that you don't feel this dread about not taking deals. Does that make sense? So like we use marketing to artificially inflate the supply demand so that we can maintain the pricing power that we want for the services and products that we sell. So right now the question is what are the core promotional activities that you're doing from advertising to let more people know about your stuff so that you can have more interest so that you have five other deals behind this
(4:20:32) deal so you're not as worried about it. Good question. So in our group one of the things I shared email marketing was my go-to because one of the things you share a lot is y'all pick one. Don't be everywhere. And so email marketing was for was what I did this past year, but I did it monthly and it worked really well. That's why I'm in, you know, further along on the revenue.
(4:20:56) And then we're doing Archery Con in Brooklyn um in September. And I plan on like doing I like I was inspired by you yesterday and I was like, Tasha, don't just make it free, you know, to run ads. Why don't you like make it free but have upsale and like maybe do an archery con bundle where they get like a arm guard and get some stuff for to cover the ad spend. Yeah. And so I'm working through some of the things you were sharing yesterday.
(4:21:22) But that's going to be my league generation too, right? For schools and communities and companies and all things in New York City. So I hope that helps. Like I've been listening. I just feel like I'm in this weird space. No, you're good. So let me let me ask you this.
(4:21:40) So, what would it take for you to 5x the amount of email outbound that you're currently doing to generate deals and leads? Just doing it. Okay. So, Natasha, why don't I just save you so much time and risk and effort and just say just do that. Because the thing is is most businesses, especially under a million dollars a year, the solution almost always is more.
(4:22:01) And so what you perceive as high volatility is actually a symptom of a root cause which is insufficient volume. You're not doing enough which is why it feels so sporadic. So that's it. So instead of being like I have to change my bottle. What if I look at my pricing? It's like you're just not doing enough volume. So we just need to let more people know about our stuff. Keep the prices where they are. Margins are okay.
(4:22:28) If you were able to 5x the amount of deals you're doing, you would have a disproportionate drop to the bottom line, right? I would. Right. So, it's like, let's not mess with things. You have a like, is there a model issue? I'm sure there's things that could get improved, but that's not the constraint of the business. Okay. Got it. We just need to put more goense. Yeah. Just need to put more go in the car.
(4:22:51) Yeah. Absolutely. And then I think one of the things that I want to tell you that you'll be happy about with me is I reached out to like some folks I know hire up superintendent. I was like, "Do you want to do a district tournament?" And then that allows me also to pitch like schools to do a district thing to help kids compete.
(4:23:09) And then it goes back to the messaging you said I got to do more of. But you'll hear about it and I'll give you an update in a week or two or three. That's great. I love that. I think you're also our lucky hotline caller because we just hit three million copies sold. So, we just passed Harry Potter golden uh golden.
(4:23:28) That's all you. You gave us the lucky Yeah. The goblet of fire. I just want to put that on you that you gave us that luck. Yeah. Secret snaps, Ila. Well, Tasha, do you feel clear on that? Yeah. So my homework is to jump into my um CRM. Definitely look at some of the materials that you sent us and just start crafting a great offer sort of too, right? Like don't make it where do you have your current offer though, right? Your current like I want to change as little as few things as possible. Why do we need to change anything?
(4:23:57) Just do more volume of the thing that's getting you 300. We want to say okay well you're doing a monthly thing. Why don't we think about this weekly or bi-weekly? Okay. Yes, sir. I will do that. All right. Rock and roll. Appreciate you. All right, focus. I will. I will. All right. Nice to meet you, Natasha. Thanks again. Have a good one, Natasha. Have a good one, y'all.
(4:24:20) All right. The hundred million dollar men also wanted me to let y'all know. So, right now, these calls are coming from people who just bought the uh the the the mega pack. So, they they donated 800 bucks. Um so, we're just we're we're we're doing that as a thank you for everybody who uh who donates 800. So if you want donating 800 happens on the thank you page of the donating 200 page.
(4:24:42) So if you would like to increase the likelihood that uh we're just trying to call you know we're trying we're trying to call them as they come in. All right. So if you would like today what in our group answering questions. No I know but I was just say like we're you know we're pulling from there. So if you uh if you want to call then um then then go go donate more books. Okay.
(4:24:59) So if you're like where is that coming from? That's where it's coming from. All right. So next one. Do you want to go with Mustafa? Mustafa. Dream lift. I wonder what that is. Dream lift. I wonder if it's like a Oh, it could be. I was thinking like a truck lift. I was going to say it's one of those. All right, let's see. Mustafa.
(4:25:18) Hello, Mustafa. Mustafa. Hey, how you doing, man? What's up? What's up? Talk to me about Dream Lift. Is this a gym or a truck car related thing? Uh, it's a car related thing. Good guess. [ __ ] I said gym. He said car lift. I lost. Ah, there you go. The wifey picked it. Sam, how you guys doing today? I just want to obviously say thank you for all the hard work you guys put in. No, you bet.
(4:25:44) Thank you for donating books. Thank you for donating books, man. I appreciate it. And thank you on behalf of the entrepreneurs who are going to get them. You wouldn't be surprised, but your book helped me save at least tens of thousands of dollars in advertisements. So, well, thanks. I have to put that out there. Well, let me let me ask you that. Thank you, guys. No, you bet.
(4:26:01) So, I want to help you make as much money as I possibly can so that you can donate more. So, what can we uh what can we how can we help you? What's what's revenue right now? What's profit? Yeah. So, right now, Dreamlift, uh what we do is we're a subcontractor to a a school transportation broker, if you want to say.
(4:26:22) It's uh it's called alternative transportation or it's transportation for students that, you know, whether they have some sort of a condition. Okay. Or they have troubled homes or they're far out from the school from the bus. Yeah. Lane. Mhm. So, it's more like a a pre-booked Uber for students, if you want to say it, that's booked by the schools. Okay.
(4:26:41) Um the in the last couple of years, we've been we've been the number one provider for this company. Okay. And we've been doubling our business. Um but it's still limited because all the sales are coming through the the broker that gives us the rights. Um, so we're not the broker ourself obviously, but at the same point I'm just trying to figure out how what's the best direction to go about that of like how to I mean we don't have to break free from them because they do they obviously they're 100% of our business right now. I was at the at the
(4:27:13) mastermind and you said you know if you have a whale that's an issue and they are a whale. Um heard so we're just trying to figure out how to Well, you have two options, right? free from the either. Okay, so actually there's three three doors you can you can knock on.
(4:27:31) So door one is you can try and decrease the risk of the specific whale by getting them to commit to longer periods of time and more business uh through longer contracts. That's option one. Option two, you can attract more whales. Option three, you can say, you know what, this is too risky.
(4:27:48) I want to do I want to get some more minnows, but I can get enough minnows privately rather than relying on, you know, the systems rather than relying on the broker. Yeah. Okay. Because then we'll be competing with them for the same schools and and we're trying to stay away from kind of biting the head that feeds us, you know. Yeah. No, I understand. Well, so you can't can you not basically does this guy have a complete monopoly on the entire area of all schools? No.
(4:28:14) No. It's uh there's like it's one of like it's one of the smaller companies in the field if you want to say. um they revenue about 20 million but the competitors are like 200 plus millions. So we're kind of growing as they are growing also. Um but my biggest issue is that we're not in in control of the sales at all.
(4:28:36) So we're just kind of like getting whatever we're eating what whatever they can catch. We can't catch our own in a way. Well term the dependency is not good. Yeah. Of course. Yes. I learned that in the in the master class. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um so um what I was thinking is potentially that we have like our own we have built our own like uh we white labelled an app very similar to Uber if you want to say right and we were thinking of going after private pay.
(4:29:08) So whereas like parents, you know, serving the the people that are able to afford like $40, $60 rides per day for their students. So is that not biting the hands that feed you? No, cuz they're only doing, you know, school direct to school contract. Then then we then we agree. So to me, what you just described is door three. That's what I was saying earlier.
(4:29:34) So one is Yeah. So yeah, we're we're aligned there. I'm not I I'm I'm okay. That's what I say. Minnows. That's what I mean. Like individual onesie twoosies is going to be the minnows. Okay. Yeah. But if you can get them direct, then that seems fine to me.
(4:29:53) Like you might even be like you're in a space where I would be It would not shock me that you might have absurd cact ratios. Got it. I see. Yeah. It's just about capturing that one. like like once the lead comes in, they're probably going to be worth, you know, thousands of dollars if they as long as the the the driving experience for the kid is at least positive enough that the parent wants to keep going.
(4:30:16) You you're in the nuisance business and that means like you're doing something that other people don't feel like doing. And so with nuisance businesses, people pretty much just like as long as it meets a certain caliber, they'll just never think about it again and just let it keep going. So it's kind of like trash. It's kind of like alarm.
(4:30:29) It's like no one's like, "Oh man, my alarm system's so good or my trash removal is so good." It's just like you just got to do it and not mess up. And as long as you don't mess up, they'll pretty much stick with you. I don't think about it. Yeah. Exactly. So, you're in the nuisance business. And so, I I think as long as you have a channel where you can require customers, I think the white label app thing is seems a little bit like 2011, a little bit advanced. I'd rather just be like, is there a way that we can, you know, post on Thumbtac, post
(4:30:53) on uh some of these maybe more local things in order to or maybe it's local ads. So the thing is we were thinking about that like it started off as that but we don't want to have our own vehicles because right now all the drivers are 1099. Okay. They're all using their own vehicles.
(4:31:11) So we want to keep the same structure if you want to say. Okay. Um but how does the acquisition matter for that though? For the what? I'm sorry. How like but like we're talking about advertising though. So how does that affect like the fact that you have 1099 drivers versus employed drivers? What does that change? um it will change u the way we um so the the way it's advertised.
(4:31:37) So we can't advertise as a so we can't advertise as a transportation company but we can advertise as a a transportation platform if that makes sense. Like there's cities that have heard me companies. Yeah, I got you. I don't think that changes very much though for for for what we're talking about. That's more semantics. Ice could you elaborate on I'm sorry one more time on what you meant earlier.
(4:32:03) So you need to advertise a way to advertise and I'll say your transportation platform. I'll put this in quotes here so that you can acquire customers who will then use the services through your distributed base of drivers. Correct. Yes. Right. And so fundamentally that's all this is going to come down to. And so we need to either like you could still post on you know Angie's list. You could still run ads.
(4:32:21) either of those things will still work. Whether you're actually doing the delivery or a 1099 is doing it matters very little from an advertising perspective because the job to be done for the service is still the same to the end user. So the promise in the advertising or the promotion will remain the same.
(4:32:38) We will pick up your person, they will get dropped over here and we will do it on a consistent basis and they will not complain. That's the promise. And so as long as we can acquire customers at a decent price and know we can recoup it on some regular basis, that's not a bad gig. I do think that it might be worth having some sort of one-time setup fees so they can offset CAC, but I would just look at what CAC looks like in the beginning for either of these acquisition channels.
(4:33:02) Meaning whether it's thumbtack or it's paid ads, I would just look and see what it actually costs just to see and either we have to improve our marketing once we find out what that CAC is or we can change the money model such that we can break even on the front end and then let the back end be uh margin over the long haul. Does that make sense? Yes, definitely. Okay, I see.
(4:33:22) Uh cuz I was thinking of uh we you know if we could kind of set it up where it's more like a subscription model. Yeah, of course. And that would kind of give them a better advantage on the totally on the pricing if you want to say. Totally. Okay. So then that we can recoup our you can have them prepay. You can have them you can like just just so you have some some some weapons in your arsenal. Okay.
(4:33:40) So the money models book I talk about this extensively on discount continuity and bonus continuity. All right. in the continuity chapter. Um, but so weapon number one you have is if you're going to go on memberships, you always have you have unlimited names for fees, onboarding, setup, you know, what first time, first month, whatever it is, you can charge a certain amount of money up front, one time to get somebody on.
(4:34:00) And the main purpose of that is to pay the cover, you cover the cost of acquisition. Beyond that, you still have other things. So you can still say, "Hey, we only do three month like if you didn't want to charge that, you could say we only do minimum three months." That would be an option, right? Right? It's like, listen, if we're going to have, you know, if we're going to dedicate a driver and they're going to be full-time on this, you know, we need minimum premium commitments. Now, you can move, you know, you can step that up and down depending on, you know, the cash flow for the business. But these
(4:34:23) are ways that you can accelerate it. You can also have prepayment uh discounts for people, you know, buy buy 10, get two uh for the year to again accelerate cash flow in the business, pull it forward.
(4:34:35) Now, will people be willing to prepay for the year? That feels less likely for this type of service, but I think you could for sure get one to three months. Yeah. Yeah. We have we actually I had tested kind of some ads. Yeah. And we were able to get, you know, a decent, I think it was like $40 per client, uh, that would sign up for a month.
(4:34:53) And then we told them, hey, we're actually going to, you know, we we came up with something just to tell them like, hey, we're not going to service it right now, but keep them happy with the same time. Well, do you feel clear in what you need to do? Uh, yeah. No, it helps a lot. Um, okay. So basically not to obviously to like stay keep that second section where we're just kind of fulfilling for other company or doing the dispatch for that company but also kind of grow this side on our end. Yep.
(4:35:18) Or I guess private side rock and roll. Wonderful. Thank you. Congrat. Thank you guys. Appreciate you. Thank you for donating books. Thank you very much. All right. All right. So for everybody who's uh online, if you're like who are we calling? We're calling the people who donate uh the most books. So, if you want to get on the list, donate some books. All right, let's rock here.
(4:35:36) Um, so that was Mr. Mustafa. All right, let's go. Rohan, four roofers. You want to do roofers? Or do you want to do virtual rockstar? No, no, go for four roofers. Four roofers it is. Confused by the revenue profit piece, which is very high it looks like. Hello. Can you hear me? What's up? Hey, Alex. Awesome. That's been an awesome event so far. 3 million is crazy. Congrats. Thank you.
(4:36:15) Thank you. Goblet of fire status. Yeah. And uh I think uh happy birthday or belated birthday as well. Thank you. I appreciate it. Tomorrow. Is it tomorrow? Yeah. I don't even know. It's like whatever. Tomorrow. I just don't even care. That's funny. All right, man. So, uh uh talk to me. So, roofing. Yeah. Four four roofers.
(4:36:38) Is that the name of the company? Yeah. So, I I own a business. Um I'm looking at it more like a a learning not earning phase. So, it's really just me u at about 200k a year profit. Um but I kind of look at it again, it's more like more or less a job, at least at the moment. So, performance-based marketing agency for roofing companies.
(4:37:00) And the main reason I did that was I wanted to try to learn marketing and it was almost a vehicle to do that. Okay. I love that. Love that, dude. Awesome. So, it was a I appreciate that. I mean, I took a lot of it from the content that you put out there. So, um obviously, yeah, I did it, but a lot of credit will go to you on that. All the credit goes to you, dude. You did it. All right.
(4:37:18) So, then uh it was a means to achieve that. Uh not really the end business I wanted to to end up there. And I'm still doing it, of course. But uh about five months ago, four or five months ago, um I've been working with one of my clients for a really long time.
(4:37:36) Okay? And I added on consulting just for them and I saw a really good opportunity to learn a lot really fast. Okay. Uh it's worked out really well. Learned a lot. Helped them grow and I want to keep doing that and also made money because I've had a performance deal with them uh as well. Okay. So again, I want to learn as much as I can. So my thought is if I learned how to run and grow a roofing business that would be really viable. I could then productize that.
(4:37:58) So then uh you know that that's all the context that I have. So I'm head down working on this. But what I'm trying to think about is in a year or two where do I go from there so I can position myself best to then align with that? Yeah. So, the three things that I'm considering later on, um, you know, to try to learn and get to that point would be number one, trying to facilitate rolloffs, something I've seen you talk about. Um, and then number two, either just buying a roofing company and trying to grow that, maybe acquiring other ones,
(4:38:27) growing it, you know, organically or, you know, through acquisitions. And then number three would be, I don't know, like a private equity firm that uh, buys and grows roofing companies as well. And I'm open to other suggestions um, too. So, and the only additional other thing I'll say is that um my my number one goal is just to grow if that helps you answer or any anything else. No, that helps.
(4:38:50) So, I'll say that the three doors you have are not mutually exclusive. So, they actually sound more sequential than they sound different. And so, I think that your next natural the next natural step would be for you to take over or buy one of the uh roofing, you know, one of the roofers, right? And then you install all the stuff that you've learned between, you know, working with all the different roofing companies to actually run it well.
(4:39:12) Right? So that's probably step one. Step two is once you have the all the operations down, you have that business, you've grown it, you've expanded IBIDA, then you can say, okay, I'm going to you're going to be in the situation of like, do I buy or do I build? Right now, in the space you're in, there is a lot of M&A activity, but at the same time, there's a lot of M&A activity because there's still plenty of roofers that, you know, just like will sell for not a tremendous amount of money, especially the smaller ones. And so you could buy those up if they
(4:39:36) especially if they're older and they have a phone number that always keeps ringing because that's like nice because there's always, you know, an established, you know, they just have like kind of a book of business that just continues. But roofing is so transactional and and and sales heavy upfront.
(4:39:47) It only makes sense if there's long-term maintenance plans that have already been built in. So they have recurring revenue, you know, on an annual basis. Um, so with that being said, step one is I think like right now you're doing 220,000 a year, which is okay. Uh, I would want to make sure that you're really confident that you can take this over. There's going to be a little bit more risk though to be fair.
(4:40:04) And I mean it was presentation I gave today like you're going to make a bet here, right? But that's you're betting on you. So, uh, you make the bet and then you, you know, you acquire one of the the roofing companies that you feel like has is structurally sound that you can drive, you know, a huge amount of improvements in the business. Step one.
(4:40:17) Step two, you can expand that business, continue to improve the cash flow of the business. And at that point, you can choose to acquire other uh roofing companies or depending on how much it cost you to open a new location to Novo, you could just do it yourself.
(4:40:30) And that's going to be the decision that you make then once you have more information from the existing roofing company that you just took over. Okay. So then you wouldn't um you wouldn't go into then like again the private equity side and or like rollups. It would more so be buying your own and then expanding that. Well, there's nothing wrong. So So the things that you outlined are sequential.
(4:40:50) So I would not say go do a roofing rollup without ever having run a roofing company. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Or done a rollup for that matter. Like that's two entirely different skill sets and you have neither right now. So it's like I'm trying to pay down ignorance tax number one.
(4:41:06) Transition from just marketing agency and a little bit of consulting to truly owning and running a roofing business which will which will come with a ton of other things and ignorance that you're going to have to pay down. Once you pay all that tax down and you succeed, then it's like okay to expand we can buyer build. In the buyer build uh concept that is where M&A and kind of the rollup concept that you're looking at comes from.
(4:41:25) The end goal is maximizing IBIDA for lowest amount of effort and capital and it's a blend of those two things. Yeah. But it's a return on effort. I can figure out the Yeah. the other ones later on. Obviously the first step will be buying that. Yes. In terms of buying it. Um I've seen like some older things from you.
(4:41:48) Um, would you suggest like waiting a little bit then trying to do a seller financing type thing or like I guess I'm not too well verssed on on uh how I would buy a roofing company. I guess I mean I think right now step one is like you just need to like go like we're you're thinking probably like two years from now. I mean I would be open to doing it sooner. Oh no no I know you're open to doing it sooner.
(4:42:12) I'm saying that I'm telling you this will probably take you 18 months to 24 months to learn to learn how to run the roofing business. So, let me just clarify. When you're saying to learn it, are you saying from the company that I would then buy or from the consulting side to then buy it? Yes. Like, what what has to happen in order for him to buy the buy the company? Like what how does he learn? Does he buy one and operate it or But then you're saying well then he would buy it now so he could learn.
(4:42:43) Yeah. Okay. So So buy it now and then Yeah. So then would I do like try to do like a seller financing thing? Oh, so how do you make this first deal? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, I misunderstand. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. You I mean you would you want to get the lowest purchase price possible and then you want to get as little of that be cash down and then if you need to have a third party SBA loan or something like that to cover some of the cash down payment, you can do that.
(4:43:05) So you might you'll probably have a mix of three things which would be some of your capital, some capital from a third party financing arm which a roofing business is is a pretty established normal business to get lending for and then you'll probably try and get the seller financing for call it between 20 and 50%. Okay, awesome.
(4:43:24) All right, well that's uh that helps a lot. I appreciate it and um I appreciate all you guys and like I mentioned like a a lot of the frameworks that I've been mentioning here just come, you know, right from a lot of your guys' content. Um, and so yeah, just just really thankful and uh I appreciate all the help. Appreciate you, man. Thank you. Thanks for donating books, man.
(4:43:43) Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. What? Oh, nothing. Be right back. Okay. We're gonna We're hot swap. Oh, yeah. Okay, fine. I see how it is. See you, Ila. Uh, 3,000. Yeah, I know. We 3 million. Yeah, 3 million. Rock and roll. What do you think? We're partying. We're partying. All right. Bill Humphre, virtual rockstar. Let's go. 4.5 top line, I think. 600K bottom line.
(4:44:16) Hi, this is Will. Will tell me. All right. Virtual Rockstar. All right. So, we got 4.5 million top line, right? Yep. 600K bottom line. Okay. So, you got 15% margins. All right. So, talk to me like uh what's tell me a little bit more about the business before I before we go any further. Absolutely. So, uh first of all, congratulations on 3 million.
(4:44:47) Epic to watch. I was watching in real time. That was so cool. Well, congratulations on four and a half million topline. Well, right. I guess we're all winners. That's right. So, yeah. So, yeah. My business, we hire insanely talented virtual assistants for private practices. Okay. hire people from this. Oh, virtual rock.
(4:45:05) Yeah, I thought this was like a rockstar like a Guitar Hero. Oh, I was like, man, I was like, these margins seem low for some digital music thing. Okay, God, this makes a lot more sense. Now, let me just make sure that I understand the actual monetization structure of this. Are you is 4.5 million the representation of the aggregate payroll that you are that you are taking on? like someone signs up through you and then you're handling the payroll of that specific VA and then you pay them or are you doing placements on one-time fees? No, we're doing the aggregate payroll. Okay, got it. Okay, got it. So that's why the margins are slimmer. That makes
(4:45:39) more sense. Okay, so uh what are you just so I understand gross margins really quickly. What are you charging versus what are you paying for talent? Yeah. Awesome. So you know what we're doing a little bit different is we're paying a lot more overseas. 8 an hour big spender. We're charging our clients 12.
(4:45:56) Okay. Got it. Heard that. I mean, the margins now make sense. So, basically 50% of gross margin is going to overhead and then the other 50 is is is profit. That's fine. Yeah, that works. Yeah, that's amazing you guys could both see that so quickly. It's interesting because I'm on I'm working with your advisory board. The first thing we're doing when I come out next month is we're raising my prices.
(4:46:14) Yeah. As I'm expanding. Love this for us. Well, Shiron owns a has a portfolio company that literally does this. So, I'll let Shiron take it. No, I Well, this is this is great. I think Alex hit the margins on the head as well. um you want to be 50% gross margins is the right approach uh as well and and I think you're doing 50% of that being net margin so it's it's totally okay the increasing price points are good the issue then becomes uh kind of h can can you still stay sticky with increasing the price points can you do it with existing customers can you do it with new ones talk to us and talk to us
(4:46:46) a little bit about that strategy and is what's the big goal here yeah so without a doubt great and nice to meet you I I'll tell you that we are confident we can raise our prices. We have a strong brand in the healthcare space. I'm a credit this out.
(4:47:04) So, I'm confident we're going to be able to raise those prices with existing customers, but we're branching out. I started in physical therapy, which is where where I was born as a PT. And the margins in that industry are the worst in healthcare. So, as we're expanding into orthopedic surgery, when we tell them our pricing, I could say way more. I could tell they don't care. So, we're very confident we're going to be able to raise our prices. Love this. Yeah. Love this for us.
(4:47:23) Yeah. This is Yeah, absolutely. Is there a um is there are there other niches that are adjacent that are easy for you to have the talent and linguistic kind of ability to say, "Hey, we already service this and it's easy to kind of turn them on or you do you think about it differently?" Yeah. No, that's exactly how we're branching out.
(4:47:42) So, we're in that rehab space. We started with PTO. We're dominating now like the speech language area. We're getting more into functional medicine and chiropractic. And the big way we've grown is is through me speaking a lot on stages. And so I'm I'm speaking on a couple stages every month going into different industries on different like business related topics.
(4:48:00) And it's a natural adjunct for us just to bring up the virtual assistants. So um that's where I'm spending most of my time. So we're confident we can get to business. So what's the question? How can we help? Yeah, man. So this is it. Like this has been a master class on your book launch of watching the power of a brand multiplied against all the things that you teach in your books, right? And part of the reason I've been so successful and I just have to say this is because this company I started two years ago with your books. So it was lead and it was leads and offers as I was building the foundation. So I I attribute a lot
(4:48:32) of my impact to those two elements. And so this book launch is a master class of all those concepts multiplied by brand. So I've been aggressive in my brand for about a year. And even though I'm super proud of my dozens and dozens of followers, I will tell you, I will tell you, I feel, you know, I've got this rocket ship and I'm going to be looking for someone to run it for me.
(4:48:55) I've got this crazy cool team with people who've been with me, dude. On the brand side, I'm speaking. I'm, you know, writing a book. I've got like all this social media and it feels diluted. Yeah. Yeah. So, there's kind of this thing of like either I need to hire someone over there or so my big question was like what's the one thing I can do to increase the impact of my brand without like diluting the growth of this rocket ship amount. So, before Alex gives you a brand answer to this, right? Um let let me give you a
(4:49:22) I think you're thinking about it the right way and there are the the question that you ask is a good one which is do you hire the brand or do you acquire the brand as in as in do you get do you do it yourself or do you actually hire it out? The Alex will tell you some portion of this takes a little bit of time.
(4:49:39) The question is while it's taking time, how can you still get some endorse introductions? Is there maybe Alex can comment on this? Is there a way that you can say hey are there five influencers in the in the healthcare niche right now that can be helpful in driving traffic while you help build your own brand simultaneously? So you can actually see if a brand in that space actually makes sense, right? Yeah.
(4:50:04) Because yes, the brand will make sense as a as a overall delivery vehicle. However, there are I will tell you there are some there are some sectors and there are some niches where you can have the brand, but if you don't have an endorsed introduction capability, you're not going to drive any sales.
(4:50:21) So, could you could you experiment with that right now where you can say could you find a micro influencer in each of those areas or one or two to see if that actually helps? Curious your thoughts on that. Sorry, were you asking me? No, no. Sean was asking me what how fast you growing right now. Really fast. We launched literally two years ago.
(4:50:41) We're um we're projecting that are we project 10 million next year, right? So, so I I I upon hearing what you originally said, my my first gut reaction before hearing every anything else was just that I think your initial fear is is warranted, which is that you have a very new business and it's growing really quickly, which means that you probably do have some operational debt.
(4:51:04) As much as you must love your team, I can promise you that the team you have 5 years from now, you're going to be like, I can't believe I had the team that I have today. All right, so like I want to lay that out there. Um, is this your is this this isn't your first is this your first business? No, this is my third. I I have started two others and sold. Yeah. No, you sound like you have Yeah, you sound like you have chops. Okay.
(4:51:22) Um, so then you probably do have slightly higher standards with with your team. So that's good. Um, I I just I hesitate when I see that kind of growth of like diluting yourself. So I think it'd be more Okay, now I have my answer for you. I think you absolutely should invest in the brand.
(4:51:40) I do think it's a great long-term asset that it's going to position you long term for what you want this to do. That being said, there are some things that I'll bet that you're doing that are taking a decent amount of time that have low return on brand impact. And there are other things that probably have significantly higher. And so, like I my time is extremely limited, right? And so, there's probably a reason that you've noticed that like I don't I don't speak on any stages. I don't know if you've noticed that. I don't speak on stages because speaking on stages is really low ROI for me. The only thing
(4:52:03) that I get from a speaking on stage is if I choose to make a a presentation. And if I do that, my presentation gets a million and a half views on YouTube and the 10,000 people there. Amazing. But like it makes no difference for me, right? Same same with podcasts. I only do podcasts if they come to my headquarters and come to my studio.
(4:52:21) So I can walk from my office into my studio and it's like a it's just the same as like a Zoom call for me. Then I walk back into my office and I keep working. And so in looking at all the different things then trying to translate this into how am I creating the strongest associations which is really just means like how am I demonstrating status power um uh credibility and likeness for the decision makers who are buying the types of services that I offer.
(4:52:49) Got it. And so that's brilliant. And so when I think about that, I think, okay, I want maximum. So the brand playbook, which is inside of the um inside of the uh the 200 pack donation that you got. Um yes, that one outlines this like in like steps, right? So it's like these are the associations we need to if we know these are the associations. It's like branding is what you let someone know about. Advertising is that you let them know about it.
(4:53:14) And so branding and advertising happen together, but they are separate functions. Got it? And so the brand will get built by who you are and the content that you share. The advertising is what's going to grow the business in terms of the number of eyeballs and people who see it who are relevant and can make purchasing decisions. Makes sense.
(4:53:33) So I would want to say okay so like taking all that out I'd say all right where are the fish like you said you speak sometimes. I'll bet you some of these conferences have have higher density of potential buyers and other ones don't. It's probably one thing for sure.
(4:53:51) So it's like I want to speak more at only the places where I have the highest concentration of the the buying pools and then my that's my like super targeted very high ROI. And then my brand coverage I'll put quotes here is how can I give a little bit of uh coverage in terms of content so when those people check me out between when I speak and when they buy from me that I look like I have a pulse and I'm providing value in between.
(4:54:09) And I see that kind of quote branding or making content as almost lead nurture for the higher ticket nature of the sales that you're doing because I'm assuming you're selling not just one person but you're selling multiple headcounts you know per uh you know per account or whatever right that's correct right so that that's that's how I think about in terms of lay of the land in terms of how do I build this brand and then the the the brand loop that still always has to continue which you it sounds like you're doing it well but I'm
(4:54:33) just reinforcing it for you is that like the product that you have is still going is is the third part of the brand loop. It's what completes the loop, right? Like I could advertise whatever I want and make content all over the place, but if the stuff that I had, if the books that I had weren't good, I would get everyone to introduce it.
(4:54:51) It sounds interesting, they check it out, and then they would go away, right? So the the product still obviously completes the loop, and then that's what spins the wheel. That's such a good point. Yeah, that it's great because as we look at getting somebody to look oversee the ops of that, it will help me free up my time so I'm focused on the highest revenue producing actions, whatever those are. And obviously right now speaking on stage happens to be that for me.
(4:55:09) And that makes total sense. I mean Chiron Chiron 6xed real by speaking on 240 stages in a year. Oh wow. Volume bro. Yeah. 200 million to 1.2 billion. Wow. Right. Cool. Volume every like people wild. Like we had dinner in Q4 of last year in and we were talking about this exact thing which is that like and I think Natasha was on here earlier. Maybe Natasha, you're listening.
(4:55:37) Like so much stuff in business once you have the model down is just breaking beliefs around how much volume is actually required, right? Like people see my brand and my content, but like I put out I think 35,000 was what I put out last year. I think this year I probably topped that. I think I probably did like 40 or 45,000 pieces of content.
(4:55:54) There's 365 days. Right. Right. So like just the sheer brute for like people are like, "Oh man, this this this uh you know this launch was so big." It's like, yeah, I also made 3,000 ads. I did 1,400 for the first round of ads. Wow. Right. We're spending 500,000 a day, right? And so, like, again, it's like it's everything's scale. And so, once the, you know, once it seems like your model's fine.
(4:56:19) I mean, it sounds like it, right? And so, yeah, now it's like, okay, you're going to pro because the business that you're in does have a little bit of operational drag. And so, it's going to be a peopleheavy business, literally, in terms of what you sell, but also in terms of who's operating it. Well, the one the one amazing benefit here also is um when you can take the brand and put unreasonable units of effort on the front end, you are getting kind of recurring revenue on the back end, which is you know the the asymmetric return of that is insane, right?
(4:56:48) One time speech forever paid, correct? And so you could also say, hey, I'm going to do this for three years and then just wean off. that will still win because you built your brand and generated the leads simultaneously into a recurring revenue machine. Yeah, I love that and it's so inspiring because it parallels what a little bit of what you were talking about yesterday with Leila when you were highlighting the big like pivot changers, you know, were the big movements that made everything possible. The first thing you
(4:57:12) guys said was the content, but the second thing she said was when you guys went down into your company and like bootstrapped over again in a way of like working crazy hours, you learned and that for me is a little bit where I'm at in the brand stage. So for me, I get a real clear vision of like, yeah, ops, this isn't my first rodeo and I'm putting the right attention on it.
(4:57:29) It's okay that I'm grinding a little bit almost a way of just acknowledging it. But where I feel really clear now is that I want to focus on just those highest revenue pieces and build in those other elements to support it and not worry necessarily about, you know, 12 to million followers as long as I'm giving good content.
(4:57:48) I'm going to say this because it's going to serve everybody else who's listening to this, too. And this will be super important for you in terms of your content. You will you will get lured by the algorithm to make broader and broader content. You need to resist that urge with all of your power. Okay? Because people will not buy from you because of your relationship advice. And so, right right now, you will get more views with that.
(4:58:13) But because and the good news for everyone is that, and I'm so so happy about this, is that social media has changed. It's no longer social media. It still uses that terminology, but as of 18 months ago, it shifted to interest media. And so the content is the targeting. Got it. Exactly. So if you want your content to reach these healthcare decision makers, then make content about health care [ __ ] that healthcare decision makers care about and they will be the ones who see it because the AI already knows what the content's about. It already knows the type of people who consume it. And so
(4:58:47) completely ignore the the views just like don't like now I'll say this within the context of if you keep the content static in terms of the nature of the content then use views right so like if you make something that's amazing about healthcare and you make another thing that's amazing about healthcare and one of them has three times the views then that was a better piece of content for sure but if you're saying this relationship thing or this meme that I'm recreating got 10 times the views of this healthcare thing is not going to generate more sales. Yeah. It's a whole depth of like a mile
(4:59:16) deep versus a mile wide. And it's so inspiring because the vision, the big vision for me at the end of this is to have this school community that's got the largest network of private practice owners positioned to just like change healthcare to actually transition and transform it. And it doesn't matter the view. I see your point.
(4:59:33) If I'm like talking about relationships or like it's going to shift the idea of like when they're seeing me between stages going, "Oh, this guy is actually about a lot of things that are meaningful to me." Yes. I I also will tell you like if you have a chance to watch Alex and my breakdown of Rails business, we talk about just having a very clear path from when you speak to how they come into your world and I love the school community.
(4:59:56) As long as that path is very tight, you could be you could be doggedly kind of obsessive about that path. That way, you know, more input on the front end, we'll get more people into that same path. And if all, for example, if that path is getting email addresses, if that path is getting into school groups, it's all okay. I'll give you the craziest thing.
(5:00:16) I mean, when I just started out speaking, uh, I it would be weird to go out and say, "Hey, can you give me your contact information? Could you ask for stuff?" So, I actually made a deal with most of the hosts, I would say, um, hey, my speaking fee is X, but since I've never spoken for you before and this is a great conference, I want to add value.
(5:00:33) Would it be okay if I traded my speaking fee for for the speaker list and I would only send out one email to the list? Oh, wow. So they give you the list and you you stay you stay true to that promise and in that email you just say hey um you tell the truth. The organizers allow me to do this because they love the fact that I have this group.
(5:00:50) I just wanted to you know inform you of this. Click here to join the group. It's 100% free. If you just did that now you have a very clear path to one goodwill on the front end with the with the audience. Uh and then we need like a sizzle. We need like a like a a like a tactical bell bell ringer. There's a tactical bell ringer.
(5:01:08) But but I think it now gives you a way to now it gives you a way also when you say you have a speaker fee and you're you're waving that you create some goodwill on the front end and it kind of re-emphasizes your stature overall which is really powerful too and you still get the what are you what are you doing it for at the end of the day you're getting it for time in front of the audience and the list right well let's be very true to both those both those delivery mechanisms and I'll I'll also share something that is Chiron's tactic so but I will take credit for it um as I do as I do with all my tactics I'm kidding. Um, but why
(5:01:37) don't you explain the survey for from the stage for him? Uh, so the survey close is essentially a lot of times when you show up either on a webinar or on Instagram, especially in front of an audience, the struggle is you have to tell them, hey, they're they're worried that you're going to sell something, right? And instead of that, you just say, "Hey, there is no sale in this.
(5:01:56) I'm going to give you everything that we talk about. All that I request at the end of this presentation is that you would take a three question, 10-second survey, right? And then the survey essentially is half the closer framework. It's clarify where they're at, label their problem, and then sell Maui or invite them to a solution. And that's it.
(5:02:13) That way you don't you don't even you don't sell anything else. That way on all the surveys now you know that Chiron has X pain. So when you make the call or make the email or make the DM, it becomes so much more clear because you're reaching out because they raised their hand and told you what their pain was. Yeah.
(5:02:30) And so it's an engaged list rather than just like I mean because obviously getting the whole list is amazing, right? Because then all the people who will engage are on it. But if you want to have like I would say a softer ask is like if you're getting the list that's like I would say like that's ideal, right? But you might even be able to also say also for anybody who wants my slides or whatever it is like go go opt in here and then then you can get the you can skim off the top and get the most um you know the most engaged people and you can also trade one or the other because maybe they're like I don't want to give you the list. You're like okay
(5:02:53) well then can I at least just say anybody who's interested in this stuff, right? Um and then you can just lead genen from there and then you can you know set calls and close. What's cool about that too is it's really serving still like it's it's a small ask but it really is service based so it really does give us information to help us give them what they need and it's a it's a very small I love that idea I'm speaking twice this week there we go baby rock and roll well I appreciate you I want you to make as much money as
(5:03:16) possible because you donated more books and that's the that's the virtuous cycle of Mosy Nation like more books more money gets made more books get donated which then go into the hands of more entrepreneurs who make more money who then donate more books and then around we go yeah dude I'm giving out so many books because all on like my big big like here you go. Thanks for letting me listen to me talk. So guys, thanks for everything. Have a great day. You too, man. Thank you.
(5:03:37) All right, see you in September. See you. Um so everybody who's in the in the chat. Two things. One, we just put a poll up. We're super curious um what type of business you guys got. Also, if you're curious who we're calling, we're just calling the people who are who are doing the uh the 800 book donation.
(5:03:54) Um I would love to call everybody, but we're just obviously starting with the people who are donating the most books and trying to provide as much value as we can. So, um, if you want a shot at doing that, you can do that. That is, this is not an illegal raffle. Never mind. Just never mind. Just whatever. Do you know what I'm saying? Fine. All right. Uh, David Edmonson. Very, I wonder. Very UX.
(5:04:14) What do you think it is? Okay. V. I wonder if it's a UX design. Hello, this is David. David. Is very a UX design company? No, it's actually the opposite. I don't do anything. He's like, I destroy designs. I go I'm actually a critic. Uh yeah, I I'm so far away from design and that's actually how I even got into the business is I figured out what I was awful at to try to figure out what I might be good at.
(5:04:40) Okay, love it. So talk to me. So what is So what is this business? So you're doing a million million top line. Is that what it was? A million3. Okay. About 500 in profit, but then I also get paid pretty well, too. So it comes out to quite a bit more.
(5:04:57) Well, what's the what's SD? What's what's what's your total total all-in earnings? 750 last year. Okay, so you're running 50%. Great. Blew my mind. I love the I love I could hear your [ __ ] eatating grin from from what you just said. Okay, got it. Okay, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Um yeah, more money, more more people you can help. Okay, so 1.3 topline, uh 750 bottom line, and then I still don't actually really understand the business besides you're not UX.
(5:05:24) Yeah, it uh that that's been a long-term problem. Um, also the company's morphed. I've had the company for January will be 18 years, but the last five years is when it really started to become uh profitable and usable. I I focused in on the e-commerce niche. So, I build Shopify stores. Okay, that's that's kind of when I first started making money.
(5:05:44) But then when I really started making money was connecting Shopify stores to Netswuite or Acatica or Quickbooks. Oh well then that led me to the realization that basically 10 to 15% of the time when people buy a netswuite implementation it goes sideways and it goes sideways bad. That sounds low. They're willing to pay anything to fix it. Okay.
(5:06:10) So I went from making 30,000 building a Shopify site to making 300 to 500 fixing a Netswuite implementation. Is that per deal? Yeah. Wow. Wow. And how are you getting these? So, you're not doing a super You're not doing a high amount of deal volume, though. You're doing a few deals a year. Yes, sir.
(5:06:33) And all of those come through referrals, mostly through CPAs. Okay. So, what's the goal? What are you trying to do? I'm trying to get to 15 million. I don't know what the official growth path to get there. I mean, I can tell you the unofficial growth path. I don't know. I don't know if it's certified or not, but I can give you an unofficial one. Do more of the same.
(5:06:53) Yeah. Yes. You're welcome. This has been great. Thanks so much, guys. Yeah. Are are you the Are you the only one delivering this right now? Yeah, exactly. Um I'm basically a glorified project manager. I have CFOs that work for me that do most of the delivery and then I have some um then I have several people that are more button pushers, we'll say, and then I have an entire dev team out of out of uh Vietnam.
(5:07:32) And so this is kind of where it gets complex and kind of what took me for forever to get to where I am. Um, we have our own integration platform, our own middleware. So when I connect Shopify to Acumatica or Netswuite, I can do all of that 100% on my own without going through any Mulesoft or any of the other big platforms out there. Um and and also our e-commerce knowledge is typically the thing that makes someone first interested in working in us historically at least. Yeah. Okay.
(5:08:04) So you attract people through like it's it's it's a ham and the garlic situation, right? So they come in for the ham, but you got to feed them the garlic. So people come because they want to grow their Shopify and they realize their systems are screwed and so then you got to do the upsell, right? Basically. Okay. Got it.
(5:08:21) So um fundamentally right now you've got these centers of influence which are these, you know, CPA firms. How many CPA firms are currently referring you business? Because you said you're not doing that many deals a year. So I'm I'm like they're not sending you one, you can't have that many of them. And two, if you do even have many of them, they're not sending you much. So talk me through that really quick. Exactly.
(5:08:39) Exactly. I have less than 10 and each of them send less than two or three deals a year. A year. Got it. And and I just hired my first sales guy. So I took your advice that says if you figure out what's working, just do more of it. Compress the timeline. So I just hired my first sales guy and his only job is to do networking because that's what's gotten me to where I'm at. Okay.
(5:08:57) So yeah, we want to be more I would say more deliberate than the word networking itself. I would define that into terms of the actual like the actions themselves that you need him to take. So it's like we need this many connections, this many reachouts, this many meetings, etc. Um maybe even speaking um speaking actually probably make a ton of sense for your type of business but uh I think outreach is a good idea but I would say that he's going to be a combination of farmer and hunter right because the nature of how your business works which is that each of these are affiliates if you think
(5:09:20) about them figuratively right each of these CPA firms you know send you business from their existing customer base and so it takes one thing to get them to send you you know activate and send one but then you need to continue to get them to send month over month over month and so I think having some sort of way of having a cadence where you can provide value to them at no cost in exchange for them telling you what new clients they have on their books so that they can refer you more business. That's how I would be trying to design this is like how what value can I
(5:09:46) provide a CPA firm so that I can have some touch base with them on a monthly basis that can then allow me to solicit them to you know quit pro crow uh send send me business. And if you have that with 10 guys it's like all of a sudden you're at five deals a month right instead of one. Yeah. I have a question for you.
(5:10:05) Um maybe Alex you can talk through this. Tell me about this middleware layer. I'll is this is this licensable? Can you do something with it? I I'll give you an example of this. Right. So let's say you have this middleware layer and you can and you gave away free diagnostic. You said if you have a Shopify store, plug into my middleware layer and it'll give you a report on where everything is broken.
(5:10:29) Is is that is that possible? Yeah. Literally just read my emails from about a week ago. We had that discussion. U because if you're thinking about scale, you've already built the scalable platform that generates like this is what Alex talks about in the money model, right? You you need something on the front end, an attraction offer that gets people to raise their hand and you want a qualified hand raise.
(5:10:51) There cannot be a better qualified hand raise than a diagnostic that no one else can provide. Uh so that sounds like a and since you've already built it, there's no more capital expenditure to that. So it feels like something that is worthwhile exploring. Yeah, I that's the that's the crux of where I'm at. So, from a scaling perspective, if I did get five deals a month, I couldn't deliver them right now.
(5:11:16) So, my job is I'm I'm trying to fix delivery. I'm trying to take a bunch of that money and hire people that know a lot more than me. Okay. So I have I have some specific people that I'm going to try to to target to bring that um then that allows me to step back and work on the actual product side a little bit more which is the middleware plus there's actually an invoice but an AR invoicing solution that's all built in as well and that's great dude the business you've got all the great bones for a business model you need to hire a couple people
(5:11:47) so you can basically get yourself out a little bit more and then you need to be focused on promotion on the front end so that you can you can actually handle that five deals a month but If you want to get to 15 million, you've got you already actually have most of the bones already there. You just need to increase your supply first so that you can then focus all your attention on growth.
(5:12:04) Increase supply first. So increase my ability to deliver first. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Rock and roll. That was the plan. Good job, man. Yeah. Congrats. All right. I'm just a uh I'm just a YouTube guy that listens to all your stuff and tries to actually do it. So, we'll see how it works. Well, the more money you make, the more books you donate. And so, thank you. I appreciate it. And thank you from the entrepreneurs whose books you uh you got for us.
(5:12:28) So, thank you. See you soon. Bye. All right. See you. All right. Hey, can you do me a favor? There's a couple of questions around um survey close and explaining maybe you can talk use the closer framework as an ideology around this which is explaining what is the clarification, what is the label and what is selling Maui because I know you really tightly. Yeah.
(5:12:48) Yeah. So clarification is just why did you why did you do XYZ? So, every single person who you're going to sell anything to has taken one step, whether it's why'd you open my email? Why did you respond to my post? Why did you DM me? Why did you opt in for my thing? Like, there's always some action.
(5:13:05) Like, even as simple as like, why'd you pick up the phone? And why have you given me five more seconds? Like, you could almost like if you're communicating with someone, you label their prior action to them receiving your message as their indication of engagement. So, you say, "Why did you indication of engagement?" And then that then leads you to them answering the question with like I ideally you want them to say a problem which then we continue to ask the question until we get them to say that.
(5:13:32) So if someone said you know opts in and I say hey you know what what got you interested in a gym membership they they would say something like well you know I was just poking around. That's we haven't moved past C yet right because well you don't just poke around for a living right there's a reason you're poking around right? Well yeah you know I've gained a little bit of weight.
(5:13:44) Great. Now we can move on to the next step. So now with labeling, we then we basically reaffirm what they just said and say, "Okay, so you said you want to lose weight. How much you trying to lose? Where are you at right now?" And they say, "Well, I'm here. I want to get here." And you're like, "Great. So it sounds like you're trying to lose 30 pounds. You're trying to do it in 12 weeks.
(5:14:01) Does that sound about right?" Yes. Okay. So you're not going to be upset with this if we do it in less time. Okay. Fantastic. Now then it's like, now if we skip the other steps, I would usually use an O there. But if we're just talking one to many, uh, then you just, you could skip O is overviewing past experiences.
(5:14:17) So what have you done so far? Uh to try and do that and what worked, what didn't, what was good, what was bad. Let's compare our good stuff to our thing and bad stuff we say we're not like that. And then it's S, which is sell the vacation. So you're like, okay, cool. So you've got our C uh you're trying to lose weight and specifically you want to lose it in this way by this timeline. Fantastic. So I think you'd be a good fit for our thing. And so that's where the S is on the survey close.
(5:14:34) So it's like, hey, are you are you an X looking for Y? That's right. Great. Well, I think you might be a good fit for our thing. And then that's more more or less the the three questions that you're asking. um after someone gets the freebie.
(5:14:51) So if you're pitching or soft pitching, you'd say, "Hey, I've got 1,700 slides, uh it would take a long time, even if you used AI to remake these things. Um and so if you want all the whole slide deck, uh just opt in. There'll be a couple questions just cuz I want to learn more about you." And then from there, you just triage the questions to people who are are more or less interested.
(5:15:10) An alternative way of doing this, instead of CLS, which is what Tron was saying, um a different way to approach this would be BANT. So BANT was something that was invented by IBM in the 1950s and it was because they looked at all the customers they had and they realized they had four things in common and so Bant stands for budget authority need timing. So do you got the money? Can you say yes? Do you do you need this thing and is now a good time? And so you can use those same four questions as alternatives. Now they're a little bit more salesheavy. So it depends on kind of the context that you're making this uh you know
(5:15:33) solicitation in. If you're someone's responding to an ad makes sense, right? If someone is responding to an email that is outbound and they're and they're responding, the next natural response might be banned. Like, hey, before we move any forward, like this is kind of our range. This is the type of people we work with. Do you have the decision-making power? Is this something that you're looking to do in the next week or two? Right.
(5:15:50) Right. We would ask that. Now, on a survey from a stage where there's, let's say, you're at a mega event that has like a w super wide personal development thing or something like that and all different speakers from all different industries, then that might not be the, you know, that might not be your first uh sorting mechanism. Yeah. Perfect. You said short, but that was not short at No, it was good.
(5:16:08) I think it gives people enough context on when to use the thing. Yeah. Because a lot of times uh you want to be as soft as possible in the survey not to not to trigger sales resistance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully that was helpful. Good questions uh about that.
(5:16:24) And for uh for those of you who are who are just tuning in, uh we're calling people who donated the most books and so right now we're just like we're calling the people who donated 800 books or more um to donate books. You can go to the link or you can look at Greenman, our hundred million dollar man over here, go.acq.com. acq.com. There's probably maybe there's a phone number somewhere. I'm not sure. I don't I can't see the stream.
(5:16:41) Uh but maybe they put a a phone number up because I think we have a couple uh we have not a couple. We have more than a couple people who are who are taking calls. All right. So, this is D. Folks, you can go to link or you can man. Hello. What's up, D? Hey, Matt. What's going on? Okay.
(5:17:00) My YouTube. No, you're good. It's a 5-second delay. Okay. So, uh revenue is 2 million bucks a year. Profits 500,000 a year. Alpha Omega Wellness ketamine clinics. This is this is more Shiron this is more Chiron's area. This is Chiron's area of expertise. This is not my uh this is not my forte. Go ahead, man. Go ahead. So, yeah. I Great to talk to you guys. Happy birthday tomorrow. I've learned so much from my bam days when I've been out here in Vegas.
(5:17:25) And uh I'm sitting here with my 8-year-old youngest son, future entrepreneur. Say hi. Hi. Hey. Hey. What's up, man? Uh, yeah. So, he's going to blow up business more than me. Maybe more than you, Alex, but maybe not. Oh, I'm sure he will, man. I'm sure he will. Um, here's here's the deal. So, we we do I ketamine and we really see a 75% decrease in depression and anxiety scores in like three or four weeks.
(5:17:48) Amazing. But I'm trying to increase our show rate to our consultation. So, most of our consults are happening online via phone or Zoom. Um, and so we got about a 40% show rate. And when I was out there at BAM last month, we talked about that. So, we're still implementing some of those things, but I would just love to get some feedback of how we can get maybe 60% of people to show because I think if we can just build more value, I mean, my goal is I want people to be like, man, I'd leave my mother in the rain at the bus stop in order to not
(5:18:19) miss this appointment with them. Mine I' I'd leave her there anyways, but um I don't have to go to the appointment. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's a joke. Um Okay. So, I think I think your instinct is right. There are probably still more boxes you need to check the the playbook that you just that's that's on the way.
(5:18:36) Literally just follow the whole thing, the entire checklist. All right, that's number one. All right. Um number two, I'm going to bet so some of the biggest levers on throughput are going to be things that you can say yes, I'm doing it, but it's not a binary of am I doing it, but to what degree am I doing it? So volume is one of those number one.
(5:18:54) Number two is going to be the speed. Like if you get a if you get a scheduled appointment that you scheduled immediately versus that you that you're able to book, you know, 3 days later, the immediate one is going to have a higher show rate. Also, the latency between when you're booking the appointment from when you speak to them is also going to have a huge uh lever on show rate.
(5:19:12) Yeah. So, we we did decrease our um rolling calendar in GHL to four days from like seven or 10 days. So, and I think that's I think that's helping. We're just we're too new into the changes to really know for sure. But okay, you know, we're doing like an ethical bribe with a gift. Okay. I'm actually starting to do that.
(5:19:36) My sales people who are calling with a personal voicemail or personal video from their cell phones. Yeah. And so, yeah, but I'm kind of thinking of like is there any little piece of content that I could send them? Yes. No, it's a great it's a it's a great question. So, think about it like this.
(5:19:52) I would ask so like what I would want to do like if this is like this is how Alex would really solve this problem like if this was my business and I owned it and it was a huge constraint I would spend all my time calling the 40% of you said no 60 are not showing right okay so call the 60% and say hey don't need you to come in totally cool I just want to understand why you didn't and I think that you will be able to unearth the three largest um obstacles that people probably have.
(5:20:18) So like I'll tell you an example. We'll say like something that blew my mind. So I found out a lot of people didn't want to show up to gym memberships who are overweight because they were embarrassed about like showing up to a gym and sometimes girls get intimidated which was a concept I have never thought of because like I've never been like oh I don't want to go to the gym because I'm intimidated. It's just never been a thought to me.
(5:20:35) I'm like I'm just going to go to the gym, right? But if you're overweight and you're ashamed or you're like oh well there's all these guys and they're big, you know, I don't know what I'm doing. What if I get hurt? All these other things, right? And so what you'll find is I'll bet you it's not one thing, but there's probably three or four buckets that different avatars will present with.
(5:20:53) And the lead nurture one can account for those things, but also the VS like do you have any kind of video prior to um them opting in or anything like that on the on the flow for a new prospect or customer? Yeah, I just got that filmed and edited. It's about six and a half minutes. We haven't implemented that yet, but we're actually going to require them to watch it confirming their appointment. Great.
(5:21:11) Well, that I mean, I'll bet you that. Okay, so I I'll just tell you right now, like secret sauce. Um, creating the VSSL will probably be the single highest leverage thing that you can do. That's a one-time fix for lead nurture and closing both just about anything else.
(5:21:30) In a sales motion, yeah, it's it's got you can get away with whatever you want if you frame it right. And a VSSL is literally all frame. Um I will have one idea that uh has worked in very similar situations especially in uh in kind of preventive healthcare uh that we've seen which is you have to do this ethically but let me kind of frame how this works.
(5:21:47) Let's say the call the sales rep's call is with Alex tomorrow at 4:00. The sales reps calls one day prior at 4:00 and he calls one day prior and say hey Alex is this this is Shiron calling and normally get a voicemail or whatever at that point. Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed. I called you one day earlier. I'm actually looking forward to our call tomorrow.
(5:22:04) I actually have a great game plan set up for you. Um, and so that one early appointment and then it's like, hey, hopefully you watch your watch the video that we sent you and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at 4, right? That one little call that happened 24 hours prior, even though it seems so innocent from a chiropractic or, you know, preventive healthcare basis has changed so many people. it. So, it serves as both as a I'm confirming your appointment with the dentist call.
(5:22:29) At the same time, it shows the prep the prep and the energy of the sales rep in a very thoughtful way without it being aggressive. And so, you can use the playful tone do that and it seemed to work. So, one one idea to experiment if you will. So, I just have a quick question. So, when people don't want to pick up their phones these days, Alex, how would you get the 60% who chose not to show up to the appointment? Like, how do I get them to engage? Because my concern has been I'm just going to spin my wheels.
(5:22:57) Dude, the the 60% we don't need to like contact all of them. Man, we like it's it's like a this is like a onetime lift. Think about it like a project. So it's like if you have call it a hundred, you know, you know, people who missed appointments over the last month, whatever it is, right? Just make it your mission to talk to as many of I we're worth the last 200.
(5:23:15) Like doesn't matter, right? Like you just want to talk to as many of them as you can to just find out the answer. And then once you have the answer, and this is really this is nuanced but important is you want to describe the reason they didn't show up in the language they use. So if you saw so I'll give you an example. So you saw the presentation yesterday and maybe today. Right.
(5:23:34) So in the the the the narrative section where I talk about the 10 biggest decisions that that shape my life. Right. Right. So in that section the if I say I've got a lot going on right now and I also say let me see how some of these things that I have going on work out. Those are all I'm busy statements.
(5:23:52) But if I say only one of those things that's only going to resonate with somebody who would literally describe it to themselves in that language. And so by stating four or five different ways of of saying the same quote objection and then overcoming it with one thing that overcomes all five which are still the same core issue but still described differently. You'll have a higher percent conversion overall.
(5:24:13) Does that make sense? Yeah it does for sure. Okay. So when you're asking them it's like one I would record the calls if you can but you want to use as as close the syntax as close as you can to what they describe the reasoning behind why they didn't show up as.
(5:24:30) So then how do you use that in that nurture sequence leading up to it's going to be it's going to be in the VSSL because think about these as FAQs or like these are objections right the fundamentally they're objections I mean they're they're if you if you think about like what is required for someone to buy well they have to show right what's required for someone to show they got to schedule well you've got the scheduling part down you may be you might also be um how actually how are schedules happening right now so right now I love show request people request an appointment they request an appointment and then our VA reaches out to confirm that
(5:25:01) appointment and then the appointment is booked. But is it from is it from ads or what is it from? Oh yeah, most of it's from ads. So we're doing about $27,000 a month in in ads. Heard heard. Um and it's a VA so you can't have somebody talk to them on the phone. Um we did do that and then we thought maybe part of our response rate is like people don't want to answer the phone.
(5:25:25) Although I'm getting ready to implement a uh agent to actually do those calls. You telling me that you have 40% now makes a lot of sense, right? Like it's just like they haven't talked to anybody. So, it's there's no stakes. It's very easy to cancel on somebody you've never spoken to. But it's even better. It's it's super optimistic because you getting 40%.
(5:25:42) Yeah. It's actually not bad. Yeah. It's not it's not terrible for how how low touch your current thing is. How poorly we're doing it. No, no, not at all. It's not poor. It's just that like you basically have to sell the appointment. Correct. You know what I And right now it's not being sold, it's just being scheduled.
(5:26:00) And so a lot of the show rate is just how the how the how the actual appointment itself is being positioned. Okay. There was also so bas Yeah. Yeah. I'll say one one last thing. You can make the call but if you you can try the multimedia approach as well. If you think that the person is going to maybe there's a text maybe there's a video text message which is just a you know 60-second video that goes out which is just you with a selfie video that is reconfirming the appointment and you can say hey you know Jenny from my team just called. I wanted to make sure you got the call and then that's all looking
(5:26:25) forward to meeting with you tomorrow and that can go out as an automation as well. So you have multiple ways where you're touching them. Again, as Alex said, you're just selling you want to touch them in many ways. You're just selling them to show for the appointment. That's all this is. So back to the VSSL part of it is like now you're going to find that things come up and they get in the way.
(5:26:43) But let me just tell you, so kind of along those lines, that's how you put it in the So the VSSL is going to like if I had to order this, the biggest lever is going to be the conversation. The second biggest lever is going to be the VSSL. Okay. So, the conversation with a setter is what you're saying. Yeah. I mean, ideal world.
(5:27:00) Again, I don't know what the cost basis is, but I'm going to guess that having somebody whose phone reaching out is not going to cost you too much more than current. Um, and I think the le it could literally flip to from 4060 to 6040 just from that by them doing something that we call, you know, we call it integrity tie down, which is just like, so is there anything that's going to prevent you from making this appointment? Let me give you a couple reasons that sometimes people will miss them. Are any of these going to be reasons that you're not going to make it? Once you get someone to commit over the reasons they would normally
(5:27:29) cancel, the show rates will go up because you like sometimes people will book appointments to get someone to stop bothering them. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, just as a super frame for everyone that's watching and listening, if you can figure out there's an insane amount of leverage value from figuring out kind of it's the set show close, right? If you can figure out the set, show close ratio.
(5:27:52) The set to show is a really really powerful thing to to get you to obsess over because sometimes we forget what we are actually selling. The ads are selling what they're selling they're selling the appointment selling you to the to schedule this then from when you have scheduled you're selling them to show and you don't have to you're selling them to show with a frame right but so if you can figure that out the the am you know kind of the amount of leverage profit that you make is insane. So, just know I I think I I was
(5:28:16) zooming out here talking about your situation, but it you're in the you're in a very fixable situation with the checklist, but um it's awesome to you're walking in with a 40% kind of show rate, which is awesome, man. Good job. Rock and roll. Thanks, dude.
(5:28:35) Well, let me just briefly tell you guys that as you and your team, Alex, help us to scale, you're saving people's lives because uh literally I had somebody this week tell me that he's alive because he got this therapy. So, thank you for what you do. You're making a real difference in people's lives by helping me touch more lives. So, thank you. It's all you and I appreciate it. But you're the one you're the one doing the work, man. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
(5:28:53) Yeah. All right. All right. So, um again, for anyone who just tuned in, um this is we're we're basically just taking calls from anyone who donated 800 bucks. Um anyone who donates 200 bucks gets everything that's on uh to my left uh for free. So you get the lead system free which includes all four playbooks here. I'll just show you guys what it is if some of you guys are tuning in.
(5:29:19) So you'll get all four playbooks which is the goated ads playbooks to help you scale your ads. The hooks playbooks will help you scale your content. The branding playbook which is actually the content that's contained within your content so you make the associations to command higher prices and ultimately you know create a future proof business.
(5:29:31) That one takes longer but it can happen faster if you do it right. Uh there's market machine which allows you to operationalize the other three playbooks. So that's the first four that you're getting for free when you donate 200 bucks. On top of that, you have the closing uh the sales system.
(5:29:43) So, you get lead nurture, which we were just talking about some of that. There's a checklist in the back of this thing worth its weight in gold. We got so Allen is a company that we owned and we, you know, analyze 100,000 plus appointments of every single touch point that increases the likelihood someone shows.
(5:29:55) We put all of that into this checklist so you can just follow it. So, that's leader checklist. You've got closing for like what are the my one of my favorite parts of this is seven universal closes that everyone needs to learn. Uh and they work no matter what someone says. That's also free.
(5:30:08) And then on top of that, you have the proof checklist which allows you to condense. So when we talk about VSSL where video sales letter that is an element of proof and we want to follow the checklist inside a proof checklist in order to uh facilitate speed up people actually buying. So you get the lead system free get the sales system free. You al get the delivery system free.
(5:30:25) So that's going to be LTV and retention. So this is decreasing churn. This is getting them to buy more times in more ways. And so by doing that you jack up LTV. So both of those things delivery system um both those playables come for free when you donate 200 bucks to other entrepreneurs. So lead system free, sales system free, delivery system free.
(5:30:42) And then you finally have the profit system. So when we looked at businesses, some people, you know, can't get enough leads. Some people can get leads, but they can't close them. That was his situation, right? Then we have uh people who get leads and close them, but they can't retain them. Uh and they can't get enough LTV.
(5:30:54) Some people do all first of these three, but they still just not make enough money every month. And so there's three different kind of ways of doing this. Now, we talked to one of the people earlier, they needed to hit up, I think it was Natasha, she needed uh she needed help her existing list harder.
(5:31:06) This is what the fast cash playbook is all about is a cadence of making solicitations to the audience in such a way that it doesn't turn them off but also just generates more cash. This is something that drops straight to the bottom line because it's already working what you already have. So that's the fast cash playbook.
(5:31:19) Um the next one is pricing. This is my top 10 pricing optimizations. I've never seen a business that has all 10. They're things you can immediately use um if you're a business owner that can help you uh cover the donation. I'm not promising that. I'm just saying that's what I would start with.
(5:31:31) And then you have price raise letter which literally is exactly what it sounds like. just so tested because we've done it so many times um that you could literally do nothing else. Just send the letter and just make more. Not a promise. I'm just saying that's how price raising works. All right. So, you get all 12 of these playbooks. People paid $35,000 some people on the phone for just a portion of one of these. Not even the whole playbook.
(5:31:48) They also had a one day in person delivery. So, I want to be clear, but you get all 12 for free when you donate 200 bucks. We also trained in ACQAI um which I did 226 inerson consultations uh one-on-one. people paid $135,000 over the last two years. This was an un like look at this. This these are my actual notes.
(5:32:10) Um it was just intake calls, recommendations, looking at the the actual constraints of the business, coming up with a plan, delivering it in person, doing follow-up calls with 226 unique businesses with the sole purpose to train an AI on how to specify which playbook and how to personalize it to each industry. So that for those of you who are like, man, I don't know if it works with a marketing agency. I don't know if it's going to work for an influencer. I don't know if it's going to work for a coaching business.
(5:32:27) I don't know if it's going to work for a roofing company. I don't know if it's going to work for a plumber. Yes, it will cuz I not only worked with one company like yours, probably multiple and probably some bigger and some smaller. You can literally just ask it.
(5:32:40) Um, and so that is trained on all 12 playbooks plus the notes you haven't seen plus 226 of these. Um, and the notes that of all three of the books that aren't released. All right. And to make sure that you know how to use the AI as good as possible, that's why the ACQ implementation workshop. Um, one day in person for this is $35,000. Uh, we're going to lead I'm going to be leading you through it virtually.
(5:32:58) You get this for free when you donate 200 bucks. And uh for those of you who just uh tuned in, you can see the counter right now. Um this is the Guinness book record. So we have the fastest selling non-fiction book um of all time. So we uh on our way up we uh we surpassed uh George Bush's decision points and then we surpassed Bill Clinton's uh my life.
(5:33:23) I can't remember what it's called. Anyways, Bill Clinton's book. Then we had uh Becoming by Michelle Obama. Then we had Promised Land by Barack Obama. And then we uh dethroned uh Prince Harry. Please don't kill me all the politicians. I'm just just you know, you know, I'm just just a guy on the internet. Anyways, uh anyways, so they were doing he had 1.
(5:33:46) 4 million was the record. Um and we did uh 2 I think nine. Um, and so anyways, every single thing that we put into this launch launch blueprint. Okay, so this contains the emails, the text, all 1700 slides, which you would not be able to recreate with AI because it would be absolute nightmare like you wouldn't be able to do it. It has the transcripts, has the production notes, it has our entire timeline.
(5:34:08) And I think the most valuable part of this playbook is actually the internal memos that we used to document each of the decisions. So when you put an event like this, this is like this is if anybody's had a wedding before. This is like having a hundred weddings.
(5:34:27) The amount of details that are required to to do something like this, like this took two years fundamentally to actually put together and all of the assets which cost me millions of dollars like literally not like oh it cost me mill like it cost me millions of dollars. Um you get all of it for free when you donate 200 bucks to other entrepreneurs. And so one of the cool things about this one specifically is that this one is a digital asset. This is all physical.
(5:34:45) All this stuff is this come in the mail. All right. And comes in this nice premium binder here. D. Um, but this guy is digital. And I think the advantage of that is that you can allow you can use these assets to inform whether you want to launch a new location, a new service, a new product, uh, a new event, whatever it is, you can launch it. Everybody's got to launch stuff. And so that's also free, but that one's only while the live stream is on.
(5:35:05) And so I'm going to keep going or maybe not. But if you're on the fence, just go grab them now so you can lock it in. Um, and all that stuff's free when you donate 200 books. The big mission behind this was that um, books have changed my life. Experiences that changed my life more than just about anything.
(5:35:24) And I wanted to facilitate that for as many entrepreneurs as possible. And so two years ago, I asked myself the question, what would I have to give to get business owners to incentivize them to help me donate books and put books in the hands of every entrepreneur in America? Eventually, the world, but for now, there's 32 and a half million in the US. And I'll start in our own backyard first.
(5:35:42) Um, and I think the reason that this like got me so motivated was I mean all the names that I named on that non-fiction list, something that was weird to me or that stuck out was that all of them were politicians and both sides of the aisle. So I have no, you know, whatever. Um, but I was like, why is it that all the non-fiction bestsellers of all time are all politicians? I was like, I feel like we're the ones who pay the bills.
(5:36:00) We're the ones who pay the taxes. And I feel like one of us should own that record. And um, I see this as our record. I definitely don't see this as quote mine. Like this was this is 100% a team effort. Um, and so my goal is to put these books in everyone's hands.
(5:36:17) And so, um, we're able to break the record and hopefully we'll get way more PR around this so more entrepreneurs will find out about it so that more people will get the books, get the help they need. And then the goal here is that we can create this self self-licking ice cream cone, this snowball, and you've heard some of the stories of people who called in um where like, hey, I read your first book and then I read the second book and then I built the business off of it.
(5:36:35) I think Virtual Rockstar was saying that he's like four and a half million, $600,000. And bottom line, I'm not guaranteeing that. I'm not saying that your results will be different. All right? But he used the books, was able to build the business he wants and so he would then came here and he donated more books. So that's the cycle I'm trying to proliferate and that's why we're doing this stuff. This is a donation book drive. So um I appreciate you guys.
(5:36:53) So that being said, live it's a lot the all that stuff you'll get. The only one that's live only that will disappear is that red uh that red uh launch bonus which is the blueprint. All right. So that blueprint goes away um when this live stream ends. All right. So, uh, if you're on the fence, do it now. Go to go.acq.com.
(5:37:12) There is also, um, we got a partnership through a firm. So, for those of you who are in the US at least and qualify, you can get it for $249 a month, uh, in 24 installments. So, Chipotle burrito a day, if you will. That being said, let's call the next one. Um, I'm calling people who donated uh who are donating books right now.
(5:37:30) Um, the top one. There's a lot of questions in the chat about this. My bad. No, no. Um if Alex and I will talk about this, but if you are selling by appointment, oh yeah, this was very important from a VSSL perspective. Everyone a lot asked about what is a VSSL, etc.
(5:37:48) If you're selling by appointment, you're probably putting a lot of effort on the front end, either with an ad or a video or content, etc. And then getting people to schedule an appointment and then as soon as they schedule an appointment, all we say is check your email. There there can be a more delightful thing because at that point, at the height of interest, someone has taken made a decision to sign up with and and schedule an appointment.
(5:38:09) do something more then which is why we suggest this idea of a VSSL which is a which is a video sales letter and essentially it is a video creating a a next step process for them right so two things happen there one they are at the height of emotion as to why they scheduled it so you're reaffirming why they did why they made that decision and second you're pre-framing what comes next the most thoughtful thing that you can do is to tell somebody here's what happens next that is the greatest thing that you can do in sales so now they know hey I booked this appointment with Alex what happens next they know exactly what happens Next, right? So, the two things that happen there are number one is that it is a lead nurture mechanism where now
(5:38:40) they are happy that they did that. They have some connectivity with you that they did that and so they show for the the they have a higher likelihood of showing up for that call. Second is you're also pre-framing the call itself because now you can reference did you watch the video as the opening part of the call which allows you to have a much more easy way to break rapport on that call or get rapport on that call. So, anything else you would add on the video sales letter? That's it.
(5:39:03) You know, yeah. So, it doesn't matter if you're a, you know, real estate agent, mortgage broker, coach, consultant, just don't think that they're going to book account, and then you'll see them in three days. Yeah. No, take a take a minute to actually create some delight around that process, teaching them here's what happens next. Yeah.
(5:39:20) A lot of the So, VSSL structure, I have like two structures that I that I tend to work off of with VSSL. So, if I have a what I would consider a like very well understood service, so like I'm a chiropractor, then I'm going to usually do just like a kind of five W's like who, what, where, when, why, how, of how is this going to work.
(5:39:36) So, this is like let me tell you what to expect, you know, when you're expecting who, what, when, why, you know, why, how, and then um I'm going to go through the biggest objections that someone's typically going to have around purchasing my thing. And then for each of those, we're going to follow the belief breaking framework. So, if you haven't, maybe my camera dudes can can walk through this with me.
(5:39:55) But you're going to say this is how you break the beliefs um on a VSSL or really anything they believe. Step one, step two, say why they're wrong. Three, say what's right. four proof. And so it's like, okay, I've got belief number one I need to break. Belief number two.
(5:40:31) And when I say beliefs, a lot of times it's just like what are the thing like beliefs is just like this amorphous thing. It's like what are the statements that get them to that they say before they say no, right? So they say I can't buy because and so you just want to handle all the becausees. So because one, because two, because three, and because four. So the because and let me tell you that that's why that's wrong.
(5:40:50) Uh like you name it and then you say why it's wrong. and you say, "Let me tell you a different way of thinking about it and then let me give you proof of somebody who had the same issue like you and overcame it." Right? So that is how we structure it. It's a who, what, when, when, how. And then we look at what are the three, four, five most common complaints or objections to showing up and then we cover those.
(5:41:07) And then if you want, you can just add even more proof um at the end. If you guys want to like look at a sample, like literally just go to go.acq.com. Um I think there might be one that's called I think it might be recap. Maybe the team will know. Um, but it's like a 14-minute video that I have that's literally it just follows the same framework.
(5:41:25) And I would say this, having a VSSL will outperform not having a VSSL, period. So, like if you don't have one right now, especially an appointment based system, you will you will you will significantly benefit from adding it. Secondarily, um, people want to make it seem like it's a black box, like there's this big magic of like there's NLP and there's this manifestation and energy that you have to put into like you just need to give them the information required to make a decision, right? Like fundamentally all we do is we move a prospect from uh
(5:41:57) consideration, which no one knows what that means, but from they don't know any enough about you to buy to they know enough about you to buy. And so the question is what are the things that someone must know in order to make a purchasing decision. Now what's interesting is that there's two vectors on this.
(5:42:15) Vector one is that some people in general require less information to make the decision. These are more impulse buyers. Some people say they're emotional buyers. I think that is a whole bunch of who knows. But all we know is that it just takes less to get these people to buy. Emotion, not emotion. I don't care. I just know that there's less information. They buy. They buy faster. Some people take a ton of information to buy.
(5:42:33) But overall in general the more information people get the more they move along the curve towards purchasing. And so the point and the reason that having a quote brand will get you significantly larger audience is that 97% of people are not ready to buy right now. Now that's just a very cited marketing step but the vast majority of people aren't ready to buy today.
(5:42:51) Right? And so the goal is how can I just continue to provide information such that when that day comes not only am I the first person they think about but they have more than enough information in order to make the decision. And then we then described them as a fast buyer, but it wasn't a fast buyer.
(5:43:07) It was just fast from the time they engaged, right? And so I do this little exercise when we have people come to our to our workshops and I'll say, "Hey, who here has uh you know, who here heard of my stuff in the last 30 days?" They'll be like one hand. I'll be like, "Okay, who here heard my stuff in the last three months?" They'll be like two or three hands. I'll say, "Who here last six months?" It'll be like six hands.
(5:43:25) I'll be like, "Okay, last year." And then it'll be like 15 hands. I'll say more than a year and 80% of room will raise their hands. And so the point of that is this is that most sane people take more time to make a purchasing decision. Period. And that's because it's normal.
(5:43:44) Now entrepreneurs, business owners, especially if you sell consumers, you have to get out of your own mindset here because you entrepreneurs in general are more risk um uh not averse. The other one riskfilic, right? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Risk prone, right? like we don't mind. We risk tolerate. We can tolerate risks. Much higher risk than most people can because the nature of what we do. We play in bets. We make investments. We allocate resources on a regular basis.
(5:44:05) So, it's normal for us to constantly be thinking like, I can make this bet. If I lose, it's not a huge deal, right? We can make these bets and then we just try and make we try and win more bets than we lose fundamentally. That's what we're doing. And so, we have to get out of that mindset sometimes for a a prospect or a customer not think, oh, there's something wrong with them.
(5:44:23) It's just like it just takes some people more time to make a decision. And that's okay. And so, what do we do in the meantime? We give them more information to make a decision with. And that is what the content of your branding is. That's what the content is. You're providing the information that is required for them to make a purchasing decision over the long haul.
(5:44:39) Now, part of them making a personal decision is sure, there's an element of like, can this person do the thing they that that I need? Some of it might just be like, do I like this person? Do I believe they're credible? Do they have proof other people like me? Right? So, these are the layers of what are all like, if you think about each person as like a vault, they have these different numbers. It's like, what are all the different numbers? Now, someone might come in naturally predisposed to not needing three of 10 numbers.
(5:44:58) Okay, so when you market in general, you're hitting all 10 over and over and over again. A sales call, the reason sales in general will increase the conversion of any funnel is that let's say that pull this over. Thank you. So hopefully you guys are finding this valuable and then we'll uh well I'm going to I'm going to take the next calls of people who are or donate more books.
(5:45:20) All right, but hopefully you guys you guys dig this. So if you think about this as the total let's say this is your current audience okay and right now you currently are converting you know this percentage of your audience. If we add a sales team what happens is we kind of artificially go down into our existing audience and we reach some of these less people who have less information and then the sales people just fill in the holes.
(5:45:48) And so when they have the conversation, it's like, okay, this guy's got, you know, uh, 2 468 covered, but I have to cover 13579 in order to get the sale, right? And so the salesperson plugs the holes and then all 10 holes are plugged and then they buy. Now, why is it that sales stops working down here? Because the person needs 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. It's not worth it.
(5:46:09) We need to market more, right? We need to give them more information prior to them taking action. And so adding a sales team, for example, will just give you a one-time increase in conversion on the leads that you currently have, but it's not you're not going to 10x with a sales team. You might have a double because you're going to double your conversion, but then still long term, you're going to need to expand the brand, dig the well deeper, expand awareness so that you have more people overall. So that this whole thing could be filled in without a sales team.
(5:46:36) And then this becomes your new sales team alpha, if you will. what's gained by adding a sales team. Hopefully that makes a little bit of sense. And so with that being said, it's probably time for our next caller. All right. I always think of that. I think it's like is it is it It's like calling y my girl ain't giving it like the way she used to.
(5:47:01) You know that uh the beginning of that song. It's like a rap song. I don't but she ain't doing the things she used to do. Somebody if you could put the the the name of that song that would be great. Somebody in the chat. Okay. Uh man, let's go here. Let's We did D, right? Yeah. Did we do Christopher Pal? No. Okay. Ets advantage.
(5:47:25) What's your guess? No idea. All right. Oh, it's international. Exotic. I think it's UK, right? No, it's not UK. Is it 44? Hello, Christopher. Yep, that's me. Is How you doing, Alex? Excellent. Are you Are you a UK number? Yes, I'm in. Nailed it. Nailed it. Okay, awesome, man. So, tell me what ETSs Advantage is. So, we're a test prep company. We're an English test prep company.
(5:48:02) So, we help people move to English-sp speakaking countries by preparing them for an English test. Well, I never had to, but Chiron had to take an English test when he got here, so I feel like Okay, so you guys prep people for tests. Got it. And you're doing mostly immigrants, correct? Yeah. Okay, heard. So, uh, revenues, what was it? You got 1.2 in bottom line. I remember seeing that. Yeah.
(5:48:27) So, what's top line again? Three. Okay. Three top line, 1.2 million bottom line. Heard. Okay. Margin seemed decent. So, what's um So, what's holding you back? What are you trying to do? So, we've got a lot of traffic and we get a lot of leads. Is it a YouTube channel? Convert? Yeah. So, we get around 4 million long form views a month. Okay. Uh from YouTube. It's our main um acquisition channel.
(5:48:53) Yeah. And we get around 100,000 email signups leads uh from our free lead magnets a month. and we convert about 1% of those. So, we've been doing a few pulling a few levers the last six months and things have improved. So, just wanted to talk about the things that I have been improving and whether to just keep keep doing those things or maybe uh think about other things.
(5:49:17) Well, let me before you tell me what's the lead magnet and what's the price and how do you sell? So there are multiple lead magnets and there are multiple video courses that people can sign up for. What's been really killing it is uh tailored lead magnets for each YouTube video.
(5:49:43) So if we have a general course, uh we will convert maybe half a percent of viewers, but if we have a tailored PDF, it'll be like between 10 and 15%. So it's like it's massive huge huge really that's a great just changed that in the last sort of three months. That's your that's your tactical tactical nugget for anybody who's listening.
(5:50:06) So uh super specific uh lead magnet outperforms very jig vague generic lead magnet. Okay. So you're doing that. Now the thing is is having lots of different diverse lead magnets can work fine as long as it funnels through a single front door. Mhm. Okay. So anyways so so what do you sell? So, I got the lead magnet.
(5:50:24) What do you sell? So, we sell a course with one-on-one feedback and supports. Okay. And we sell it for around $400. Okay. So, walk me through I watch a video. Uh I watch a video and then I go and get my lead magnet and so I opt in. And so then what what do I do from there to paying you $500 or $400? So uh mostly it's done through email.
(5:50:56) Um so because it's such an international audience, we've never been able to make sale sales calls work. They seem much more comfortable uh through email. So we will uh send them typically one email a day for uh about 30 days and then we have monthly uh launches where where we will do like a live uh event. It could be a one to three day event and we do those uh kind of monthly and they bring in a lot of revenue as well.
(5:51:21) Uh we also have ads that that uh would target people who sign up um through so email follow-up plus once a month you clean the pipeline. Yeah. Okay. Heard. How many people buy from email followup versus uh the webinars? Uh it depends on what uh but generally it would be about 2/3 email and a third from webinars.
(5:51:52) But even with the webinars, most of the sales come through through email. Uh this people just are more comfortable seeing it in black and white and being able to discuss things with us through email than than making decisions on video. This is a deal of the week. Go for it. So um you know one of the things that hey this is Shan great to first off great job great job building something on a 400 you you've told us one product I'm assuming there's more but whenever there is an uh acquisition channel that has kind of exactly what you're doing people are coming in through different lead magnets there's got to be one way that you can put all
(5:52:29) of them together and so the one strategy that I that we like to recommend is called the deal of the week where you can hit the entire list with a rotating offer for every week. So if especially since you have email readers, which is awesome. You're getting two/ird from email.
(5:52:47) If you just lo if you just loaded up a every week on I'm making it up, every week on Wednesday, you have a deal of the week offer, which is a really simple offer that says this is the deal of the week. This is what you get. You'll be able to hit the entire list with that.
(5:53:04) And um or you can do a PS with, you know, reply if you have questions and now you generate conversations on email follow-up. Have you tried something like that? Yeah, we we've been doing that. Yeah. Okay. So, we send uh to our entire list, we send about three emails a week. Two of them would be pure value and one of them would be some kind of offer like got a deal of the week type of thing. Okay, good. So, I'll say this.
(5:53:23) So, you're converting 1% of lead magnet optins, correct? Yes. Yeah. That's not I mean like the only way that you're going to like dramatically improve that is going to be basically a sales team. So, I don't know if you just saw the We tried that. Yeah, go ahead. We tried that in the past. Um, it's it was very difficult. Maybe we just we were just bad at sales and that could be the case.
(5:53:47) Well, did they watch Did they watch a VSSL before you sold them? No. Yeah, that was the issue. That was I'll just tell you right now that was the problem. So, you had the right idea. You just missed one of the pieces.
(5:54:04) So, the way that this would work, and maybe you'll watch this recording later, but lead magnet then goes to VSSL, which is a video sales letter. So, it goes to a little video that explains the nature of your stuff, and then at that point, they can schedule a call underneath, right? And then that goes to um that goes to the sales, you know, the salesperson's calendar, and then they can go on that sale and buy and on that VSSL, they should have an idea of how much that how much how expensive it is. Good.
(5:54:27) Yeah, that makes sense. I mean that's I mean and on so on this you'll also still include band so budget authority need timing. So that'll allow you to qualify the leads and so like if you wanted to like say like let's just go uh minimum friction besides the VSSL you could say don't mention the money and don't do bant if you want to add friction then you'd say I'm going to tell how much how much money it's going to be and I'm going to have band.
(5:54:53) And so me in general, I would say that I almost always have made more money adding friction in my whole life. And it's always counterintuitive, but I almost always make more. Even though my cost per call or my volume goes down, my sales efficiency for the team goes way up. Close rates go up, morale goes up. And I usually am also because the morale goes up because they're not hearing no as often.
(5:55:10) They tend to be more aligned within me saying, "Okay, well, let's increase the price." And so then I start have more leverage on on the pricing lever. And so I just want to say this up front, you increasing this like you you pro you might have like a double or a triple there. Not a promise or a guarantee.
(5:55:26) I'm just saying that that could happen, but you're still going to then once you do that double or triple, you're still going to be in the same position you are right now, which is you're going to have to increase more of the front end. So you can still do that now though. Why not? Um and especially if you're running ads, then increasing your conversion percentage will make a difference because then you can, you know, afford more expensive traffic or buy more of it. Um, but still no matter what, there's going to be a runway that you're going to want to expand top offunnel awareness with.
(5:55:43) How do I how do I do a big collaboration? How do I do some sort of brand stunt? How do I take somebody from can't speak English to getting a job that's really and document the whole thing? Like that kind of stuff aspirational is what's going to start making the associations with a brand over time that are going to build the bigger footprint. Does that make sense? Yeah. Totally. Okay.
(5:56:00) I I have one thing for you. So, you seem like a really uh savvy email marketer. And I I'll say this both for uh a diagnostic for you and for everyone else listening. Have you had a chance to try in your other uh emails which are non which are non deal of the week emails? Have you tried where if you're doing a piece of content and having them click out, you have some kind of tagging associated with, hey, Alex saw this specific piece of content, so he clicked out since you got a specific lead magnet. And then there's an automated offer sequence based on that clickout.
(5:56:32) No, we track uh via UTMs. Um, but we wouldn't we it wouldn't be that advanced. Okay. Well, I I this is actually super easy to do. By the way, if let's say Alex gets an email about a certain topic and he clicks in the email to maybe go watch a YouTube video or whatever, you know that Alex has an interestbased click that tags and then 24 hours later you say, "Hey, based on this, here's the offer.
(5:56:55) " You don't have to do anything else because that's just set up in the tag click auto email sequence. I would look that up because that's one of the easiest lowest hanging fruit that you can set up because for every email content based email that you can send if I raise my hand and say I watched that or I clicked on that you're sending me an offer entirely based on that that is automatically pres-scheduled. I see great. Yeah, that's a good idea.
(5:57:20) Yeah, you have I mean you have you have a lot of emails. Like this is a this is a no-brainer where you're you're easily going to get easily going to get um you know kind of automated sales machine on this one. Yeah, great idea. Rock and roll. Awesome. Appreciate you, man. Good job. Thank you for donating books. Thanks very much. No, you bet. Thank you. Thanks for everything you do.
(5:57:39) No, thank you, man. Seriously. And honestly, I think if you just if you try that like you I think you had the you just literally were missing a piece of the funnel. That's all it was. I'll let I'll let you know when I'm back in Vegas. All right, rock and roll, man. Thank you. All right, see you. Thanks. All right, let's go.
(5:57:57) Sandra Chang. Oh, it's a startup. Okay. Okay. Sandra Chang, let's dance. 909 Inland Empire. Little uh little Cali. Your people. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. That's right. Okay, Sandra, we gave it a shot. Jamie Medlin, car washers or can washers or car washers? Can washers? Trash can. Okay, cool. These are fun. I love these businesses. Hello, this is Jamie.
(5:58:43) Jamie, let's talk about uh washing cans. Hey man, how you doing? Good. So, you got what? 300,000 top line, like 120ish bottom line. Is that what I read? Yes. All right. Got it. So, cans. Got it. Fun little business. Love it. I great gross margins. Really? I actually find I actually really enjoy the business overall. Okay.
(5:59:06) So, 300K topline. You got good margins already, which is actually not as common as you'd think at the size you're at because typically it's huge as great incremental margin, but typically up front. So, you're probably running this very lean, I'm guessing. Yes. Awesome. It I mean, yeah, it's it is, dude. Keep it up, man. Okay.
(5:59:26) So, what uh how can I help? Well, um, you know, one of the things that's kind of my go-to strategy has been offering a 50% off the the initial service and we're leveraging Google ads and a lot of Facebook as well. So, okay. So, you're just running a 50% discount on canwashing and then I'm guessing you doubled your price to get your 50% discount.
(5:59:50) Yeah, but I'm I'm still finding that, you know, I I really feel like the volume of new customers is pretty low. And you know, in our industry, which, you know, I also have a large Facebook group that I help others with. We have a CRM we built. Um, it's it's one of those things where I'm I'm I'm finding that hundred or so new customers a month is just really low. Okay,
(6:00:17) let's do some math. Let's do some math. Okay. So, what's what's the uh what's your average price point per can per month? So, this will be fun for everyone watching. So, I'm I want to do some math with you. It'll be fun. Okay. So, average revenue per can or per Yeah. So, with our pricing model, we're our average I would say subscription is is important here as well. So, our quarterly subscription is the most common. Okay.
(6:00:43) It's about 70% of what people sign up for. Okay. And with that around here, on average, there's about three vins that they're selecting. So, our base price is 35.99 for the first can. Okay. Then, and then it's $5 for each additional. Okay. So, it's about 40 I would say the there are the onesies, twzies. So, I would give you about a 40.
(6:01:08) 99 average is what our Okay. I'm going to use 40 as simple math sake. So, 40 bucks every quarter, right? Yes. Okay. 40 bucks a quarter. What's churn? Um, you know, I would say about four cancellations per month on what? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Churn percentage. How many clients do you have on the how many of the four you for for how many clients do you the four contributes to how many on the base? So, we have we have uh over a thousand subscriptions. Okay. So, 12 12 cuz it's times four.
(6:01:41) It's times three, excuse me. So it's four per month, but you just gave me quarterly billing. So I need quarterly churn. So that's 12 people per quarter who are churning. So 1.2% churn per quarter, correct? Yes. Okay, got it. So this will be fun for everyone. So $40 divided by 1.02. Where's my little calculator? I mean, it's time 100, but I'll just be precise here. Um 40 divid by 012. So, you have a $3,300 LTV.
(6:02:12) All right. Yeah. Great. Great. And how many And what's your sales velocity right now? How you're saying 100 deals a month? Yeah, I'd say last month we had about 130 new new signups. All right. Right. So, it's roughly 70% quarterly and the rest are one-time visits that we we put on a we we do what we can to send promos and try to get them to repurchase, but it's Yeah, that's what we're So, 70% are on subscription and the 30% are one-time cleans. Correct.
(6:02:52) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I you So I mean your recurring should be stacking every month, is it not? It is. Okay. Well then, dude, I think you're It's a slow growth, but it's growing. Well, yeah, because if you look at the sales velocity, it's like you should be I mean, you you actually have a shitload of runway right now before you even get close to your hypothetical max.
(6:03:16) Yeah. Yeah, and that's where we are, you know, from a routing and just growth perspective, we're really pushing quarterly because there's also the additional uh, you know, our monthly rate, which we just increased actually to kind of leverage the we want the customer to essentially go to quarterly.
(6:03:38) I could stack more customers and I have more cancellations on my monthly subscriptions my quarterly, of course. Yeah. Um, you go to annual even less. Exactly. And actually, our annual plan is the most canceled because they're like, "Oh, what? Why am I getting charged a year later?" This forgot. Yeah, it's fine. That's fine. It's fine. I got you.
(6:04:01) Um, so, uh, yeah, I mean, we're and the the part that I'm I'm kind of struggling with is, you know, with our Facebook ads this this last month because we also have the the weather, you know, and the and the this I would say the shoulder seasons through winter. like it's just slow. It's it's almost, you know, 80% of what we actually get on signups.
(6:04:29) It's just people aren't there's not really a ton of um I guess urgency for them to buy. Yeah. So that 130 per month is only in high season, not in year round. Correct. Okay. So if you really like sales velocity times LTV evenly distributed per month of the year will give you your hypothetical max. Have you done that math? I haven't. Okay. So I'll tell you I'll tell you a little secret from an M&A side.
(6:04:51) One of my favorite things to do is try and buy into a company where they're selling they're like we're doing 100 deals a month and we're doing you know we got $20 a month you know subscription but our churn's 5%. And so if I know that, then I know that that company is going to do a,000 times a,000, which is means they're going to get to a million a month, but they're currently at 200.
(6:05:09) And so then I can just say, cool, I'll value the company at what it's currently at, but I already know it has a 5x literally sitting inside of it if I change nothing. And so right now you're like, I don't know what your true sales velocity is because you said that was a high season.
(6:05:21) So we actually have to take the blended. So it is lower, which makes more sense for your impatience. Um, but you still probably have a significant amount of runway uh compared to what you're currently at because you're at 300,000 a year and you're like you're way out selling that right now.
(6:05:38) Um, it's just it just slow because it's so it's so onesie twoosy to your point. So I think that um we need to create a So right now you said ads is your primary way of getting customers. It is. And in the summertime we're like this past month we're we're on target to do about 3,000 or more Yeah.
(6:05:59) in ad spend. Yeah. You know, my and with that 50% off, I'm I'm kind of my new customers are essentially covering my cost. Yeah. Um of acquisition, but we're still obviously, you know, um it's it's not really where Yeah. like can I can I can I can I give you something? So, right now, you could probably spend more money and get more customers, correct? Yes. Okay.
(6:06:25) So, you're in a business that's capital intensive. It's just the nature of the business you're in. It takes more it takes a ton of time to get it spun up. You have to have trucks. There's all this other stuff, right? It is capital intensive, which is why many people do take on funding or take big loans to start this out because the issue that you're dealing with right now, which is now that being said, you bootstrapped it, which is great, right? But basically, that $120,000 like what does it cost you to get get a customer right now? I bet you it's nothing. About $25. Yeah. Right. Dude, your LTV CAC is
(6:06:50) through the [ __ ] roof. So, like said differently, if I were to take that $25, like your $120,000 of profit could translate to $480,000 customers. Sorry. Sorry, I did that math wrong. Sorry, I did it quarters instead of $25. My bad. So, divided by four. So, it' be 40,000 customers. 30,000 customers. Gez, sorry, my brain's going melted.
(6:07:13) So 30,000 customers is if you took a 100% of your personal income and put it into the business as advertising. You would make no profit, but you'd grow a lot faster. And this is fundamentally like this is the nature of why V like this is the way VC back companies are supposed to run.
(6:07:30) Now many of them have just like messed up economics to begin with, but you have extremely good economics. It's just at a delay for you to recoup it, but they essentially become an annuity because your turn is virtually nothing. So here here's a question. Would you if you had $120,000 to dump into ads right now, would you? Yeah.
(6:07:49) I mean, you know, I'm fortunate in this situation that I'm I'm kind of a an absentee owner in this business. Dude, this is this is a this is a no question then. So, if you actually can provide for yourself, I take that 10,000 a month and I'd say$10,000 buys me 2500 new clients a month. Correct. That's $4. Jesus, I'm sorry. my like my brain is dead. Thank you. $400. Sorry, 400 new customers a month.
(6:08:13) 400 new customers a month uh is what you'd be getting if you put the whole $10,000 in. And so by the end of the year, you'd have another 4,000 customers, 5,000 customers. Um and then again, this starts to stack because by the end of that year, now you have an extra $10 time 4,000, you have another $40,000 a month.
(6:08:36) Huge, right? Now, what are your gross what are your what are your gross margins, by the way? So, it's it's about I mean because you are pretty cheap. You are pretty cheap. Yeah, it I I would say it's it's around Excuse me. I don't I actually would need to to double check this. Yeah, worth knowing. Yeah, worth knowing. Yeah, it it is. It's just Let's see.
(6:09:02) I mean, like I said, that was kind of an annualized uh rate, which was the around 300 or so thousand. Um, and then about 114,000 is our our our take-home. Okay. Yeah. Uh, well, go ahead. No, no. Uh, three really mechanical things. Mechanical thing number one is just for you as the absentee owner here or just the investor, I would say.
(6:09:28) I actually prefer investor over absentee owner. It's much much better languaging around that. Um I would offer to count all numbers in the same time period because I think if you run all numbers as a quarterly time period number it'll be easier to talk about it and think about it.
(6:09:45) Uh especially since your packages are quarterly I would almost kind of your whole your whole life has to be quarterly otherwise it's conf like I sell this many a month. I've got churn is this much a month this much is build quart like everything should be quarterly if that's how you build. Yeah that would be mechanical idea number one.
(6:09:58) Idea number two is if you can afford and if you can actually deploy to this 10 grand a month idea into the business and you have the capacity to service it, this feels like a no-brainer to do overall. And the third thing uh this Alex me want to comment on this one is I'm ultra curious about a little bit of sales scripting on the 30% to actually get them to do recurring.
(6:10:21) Maybe there is either an offer at play, maybe a rollover offer at play, something at play here because you've already spent you've spent the $25 acquiring the one-time client. Could you and and your quarterly is 40. If I rolled it over, I still make money. Yeah. Yeah. So, so what's the offer that you're giving them? So, I'll give you let me give the nice thing is I've been in recurring revenue my whole life.
(6:10:40) So, the this this problem's already been solved. So, what do you think? I'm just going to walk you through it. So, what do you think if I if I go and I show up at a gym here in Vegas and I say, "Hey, I want a day pass." What do you think they're going to charge me? Probably nothing. So, actually, it's the opposite of that.
(6:10:58) So, a good gym should charge ton for a day pass for this reason, the same problem you're dealing with, provided you're local. If you're, you know, whatever. Anyways, doesn't matter. So, if let's say the the the membership is uh 25 bucks a month. Okay, we'll just keep it simple. So, it's $25 a month. their day pass will probably be 50.
(6:11:18) So they say, "Hey, if you want, you can sign up for a day pass or for 25 bucks a day, you become a member." Yeah, that makes sense. And our and on our one time, you know, it is uh significantly more than the quarterly. How much? And um it's it's about I'd say on average, it's about 50% more expensive. It just feels like a scripting thing. I think I think you're going to eek out.
(6:11:43) Yeah, you're going to eek out some cuz if you can get the 70 30 to even I this may not not look like a lot to 80 20 you're with your cact LTV numbers and putting more money in on the front end this is going to grow exponentially. And you know, I've toyed around with the idea of removing one times completely and only offering subscription at this point because we've kind of reached that inflection point where it's like, you know, in the beginning we just really did want to grab as many customers and heard kind of, you know, garbage can cleaning is just a newer thing. Yeah.
(6:12:14) So it was education. So you could charge you could charge a hundred bucks for one clean or $40 a quarter. I feel like you do that people are like, "Oh my god." It's like Yeah. whether it's, you know, $13 a month or it's $100 today.
(6:12:31) It's like, so you're basically going to get, you know, two and a half quarters done for the rest of the, you know, this next six months if you just sign up. I would just go AB close on this. And and I would also say on top of that, if you want to use a money model, right, you want to use the money model mechanism, on top of this being less, I'll also add in this other element that's a sealant that'll decrease the smell of your can or whatever, right? just some some thing some little some little thing that is only available if they take the membership. So not only is it less they also get more when you do that the AB the the the the other onetime thing will
(6:13:03) will price anchor. So what you have right now uh when you go through the money models book is read the decoy offer which is an attraction offer. I think it's the third or fourth offer uh in in in the attraction mechanisms and it explains how you can price the difference between both of these things of like what discrepancy you want between the the recurring and the one time because sometimes the one times can still be valuable, right? Like if you know that you're going to get 10% of people that pay 20 times more, you can
(6:13:27) factor that into your cost of acquisition and like you actually can cash flow because you said, "Oh, well some of these we can maybe break even." And as you spend more on ads, which you will, the cost of acquisition will go up, right? So having some liquidation up front with maybe 10% of people paying four times more, not a bad thing.
(6:13:44) No, that sounds good. Okay. And something that we have implemented is after a one-time our automation kicks out like asking if they want to upgrade the plan. No, you want to sell them right then, man. You want to sell them right then. So people have very large motivation for very small periods of time. So like uh latency beats intensity by a mile.
(6:14:06) Okay, cool. So hey, thank you so much. So I just want to sum mechanic number one is you're going to talk everything in terms of quarters. Number two, you should know and calculate your gross margins. Super important because your LTV I did lifetime revenue, not lifetime gross profit. And we would want to know lifetime gross profit. Number two.
(6:14:25) Number three, get everything in terms of quarters and then figure out what your hypothetical max will be for the business. Number four, then I would say take your $10,000 a month and I would dump a 100% of that into the business to grow. That's if your goal is to grow to be clear, but I'm I'm aggressive and so I would just want to grow it as fast as I could.
(6:14:43) But I would just say, okay, well maybe if I put that much I don't know if I can handle 400 deals, you know, deals a month. If you can't, then just scale your ad spend to your sales constraint and then that'll be the next constraint we solve. Cool. Cool. Rock and roll. Thank you so much, dude. Thanks for donating books, man. Seriously, appreciate it. Good job, man. Of course. All right. Rock and roll. All right. Bye.
(6:15:00) All right. Bye. Uh, while Alex is getting the next call ready, uh, I saw a lot of comments in the chat as we talked about quarterly, monthly, gross profit, etc. Just FYI, there are a few key numbers that it would be helpful for you to know because if you know that, then people can actually help you with your business and it gives you a diagnostic on your business. So, three really important numbers to know.
(6:15:23) Number one is your total revenue. The second is your gross profit. And the third is your net profit. If you know those three uh and you share it with somebody, a coach, a consultant, etc., it's easier to help you with those numbers. Second, we don't see this very often, but you want to tie your time period kind of language to the time periods of your general offers.
(6:15:41) It's easier to calculate that way. Otherwise, you have to do everything in your head and then you'll start to mess up. And so, even Alex and I got tripped up a little bit because we're doing quarterly, monthly, etc. So, that's kind of like number two. Number three, though, if you're ever in between a um you know, someone's taking a one time and someone's taking a subscription, that's a there is insane like leverage and variance there. That's what the money models teach you, right? You want more continuity offers. Like
(6:16:06) what is a money model? Like to get more customers to pay you more money in less time over and over again. The over and over again is the best part. Yeah. So, you want the best part. No, it is right. And so if that also means that you have to provide a rollover offer or a discount or a decoy offer something to get that 30% in in in his case to become a subscription based offer that's a really good thing.
(6:16:29) So if you have a split between subscription and one time spend some time thinking about how you translate the one times into more subscription based offers two things will happen. One you'll make more revenue and two you'll actually start to deliver a better client experience because you want to keep those people longer. So it'll make you a better business.
(6:16:47) Also, I just saw some of the chats like why did I not get the uh launch blueprint? Uh the launch blueprint number one is digital, but number two, the launch is still going on. So, I have to wait till the launch finishes. So, I'm not going to send you a halffinish, you know, uh product, right? So, once the launch terminates, that means all the texts, all the emails, all that stuff is finished. Uh you'll get it. All right? And so, again, all that'll come on Tuesday morning um for you guys.
(6:17:11) All right? All right. So, just as a heads up for those of you who are like, "What happened?" I I promise you I'm not trying to withhold uh you know, the launch. We're just we're we're still in it. We're still doing it, right? We're still going. All right. So, with that being said, uh Oh, Mahek Veroni Roy.
(6:17:25) All right. Commercial refrigeration. That sounds fun. Greatest businesses, man. Really? Commercial fridge? Yeah. I mean, there's probably like 10 of them and they can charge whatever they want. Yeah, it sounds interesting. My heck. What's up? Hey, Alex. Hi. What's revenue? What's holding you back? How can we help? Awesome. Revenue is about a million. Um, gross margins around 40%.
(6:17:52) Nice. Oh, gross. Gross. Yeah. Okay. Um, so 250 250 net. 250 net. Yeah. Okay. Got it. 40% gross margins. Got it. Um, all right. Commercial refrigeration. Uh, um, Got it. Okay. Okay. So, what's what's holding you back? Um, I think pricing. Um, I I think I sent in the context text like uh qualified leads, sales team, and pricing, but since we're talking money models right now, let's go with pricing.
(6:18:23) Um, I sell a commodity. It's a $100,000 per ticket commodity, but um it is in in the end like hard to differentiate like the value of a you know $50,000 walk-in cooler versus a $100,000 walk-in cooler, right? Um and that's kind of I think where I'm struggling because I used I was at this workshop and gave me some good advice about referral bonuses which I implemented. Um got two new clients out of that.
(6:18:56) So, I on the referral bonus, got a $100,000 client and a $50,000. So, you ROI the uh the day. Fantastic. I did. I did. And then the challenge was um that the client, one of the clients that I did pick up from that is really price sensitive. So, someone comes along with like um you know, an offer that's $5,000 less than ours. Yeah.
(6:19:22) And they'll go with that instead of ours even though we can provide Yeah. I would perceive as more value because we actually have stronger communication which is very rare in the construction industry. Yeah, I heard. Um can can I cut you off because I because I I want to help you out because I'm pretty sure I know what you need to do. Please go ahead. Okay.
(6:19:39) So the thing is is that like for sure you're providing more value. They just don't know you're providing more value. So it's a communication issue. So we have to frame it. And so I I'll explain this differently. So number one, we have three vectors of value, right? We have risk, we have ease, and we have speed. Right? So, you want to win on one or more of those ideally in terms of your core deliverable.
(6:19:59) Now, for the business that you're in, I'm going to bet that speed and risk are going to be the maybe even actually you have vectors in all three. We need to basically calculate the cost that they have to incur over a longer period of time by using a competitor versus using you. And so, when they factor that into the overall price, it should be a steal.
(6:20:17) Does that make sense? I think so. But I would love an example. So let's say that because the communication is poor on like this is where industry averages and stat stats are super valuable from a selling perspective. I would say, okay, it turns out the average commercial refrigerator breaks down once every, you know, nine months or every 18 months or whatever the number is, right? It's just like now, unfortunately, every 18 months though, it costs 30% of the average, you know, commercial refrigerator in terms
(6:20:41) of price to fix it or I don't know, again, I don't know what the price is, right? And so, the thing is is that with the vast majority of other people, they're going to uh save you a dollar today and cost you $4 tomorrow. I'm going to charge you $2 today and save you $4 tomorrow. And then that way you can you can price in the savings of the additional services and value that you provide.
(6:21:05) Yeah. A quick question for you. When when you get this kind of um commoditized, you know, price competition, let's say let's say there's a $50,000 offer from you and a $45,000 offer from someone else. How do you respond to that? Right now, we're doing it wrong by just saying we'll match or if it's like a significant difference, which sometimes they'll be like, "Oh, well, they're giving it to me for 30,000.
(6:21:28) " Oh, send me the quote for that so I can compare to make sure that the quality of the products and services are the same. Right? So that's our response to those two. Got it. So uh I think you're doing it. Uh by the way matching is okay if your economics work on the matching. So as long as your team knows when to match and if the matching is still profitable that's that works.
(6:21:49) The one offer let's talk about the matching for a second. If you are going to match something then I would try to find a way to upsell something else. So, for example, you can say, "Hey, we're happy to match that. In fact, you know, I'd love to offer you a, you know, four-year lifetime, four-year warranty for X that only kicks in in year two, right? That way, at least, you know, you have a potential price increase coming in year two that they have to potentially buy because they know that now you're giving up and matching a little bit now. So if you are matching instead of taking it on the chin today and not ever getting it back,
(6:22:20) you can take it on the chin today, match and then give it and kind of get back some value later. And when you delay them having to pay something out, it doesn't feel as bad. So something for your team to think about on that idea. Give me give a second one. If you are competing on price, I think you're doing the right thing from a comparing the invoice perspective.
(6:22:40) That process as Alex said to having the three vectors of value is really powerful because if I come back and say hey they're willing to offer for 40,000 yard or 50,000 whatever artifact we send back to them needs to be on point.
(6:22:58) So what does that like I I would I would spend a little bit of time looking at that uh because if that is a hey they're only looking at 40 versus 50. They're not looking at you know uh time in operations. They're not looking at risk of it going down. They're not looking at you know the ability to manage the same temperatures. I I'm I'm making up stuff. I don't know exactly on the from an industry nomenclature perspective, but they don't know the things.
(6:23:16) They're only looking at the one thing they do know, which is the pricing. So, we have to provide them some kind of diagnostic report on the things that they don't know because then you're now creating the value ad that no one else has addressed in that way. If that makes sense. It does.
(6:23:37) How do I deliver that? Because I think right now what I do to deliver that is just um respond like give them a call back and walk through verbally on the phone because these clients are either general contractors and always on the road or they own like capital groups and don't want to waste time on a five minute or 10-minute Zoom call to get a like price comparison, right? So, I'd call them um and give them a verbal okay well in this quote that's like 10,000 15,000 less like you're missing X Y and Z and in our quote we have that and this is a value ad. Yeah. You know. Yeah. Totally. Yeah. No, I think you're on point. There are two suggestions that I would make on that one. And by the
(6:24:09) way, you hit the nail on the head. Um how you communicate the price differential and show the value differential, if you will, adding the three vectors is really important. Uh two two ideas. Idea number one, if there is a way for you to do this, it would be awesome if you prepared whatever you prepared.
(6:24:27) Say you've got a you've got a PDF or whatever that you've prepared and if you can record a one to two minute screen share of it and then just send them a link like a Loom video, send them a link to that saying, uh, hey Shiron, just worked on this for you. I break down the entire value of this in a 1 to two minute thing. Just click the button, you can watch it on 2x speed. It'll show you how we can make, you know, we can save you $10,000 more over the long run.
(6:24:45) So you frame it and then you still have the proof in this 1 to2 minute video where you don't even have to take the call. So that would be idea number one. Here's idea number two. A lot of people don't utilize this and I think you can utilize this in the modern kind of era of all of this. You can take the PDF that you already made. I'm assuming let's say you made a spreadsheet or PDF of some sort.
(6:25:04) You can take the PDF that you already made, upload it to AI and say build me an interactive dashboard based on this and give me a public link. and then take that public link and say, "Hey, I built an in I built a dashboard for you to see how we're going to save you $10,000 over, you know, three years." Uh, here's the link and then the contractor can just click it.
(6:25:23) It a beautiful graph pops up and they see the value there. So, very easily you can take your raw data and convert it to something pretty visual pretty quickly. Okay, that's I love the AI idea. That's super helpful. Thank you. Yeah. Awesome. Um, I think you're I mean you've got you've got you're on your way because you've got the right you've got the right margins in place and I'm assuming each of these contracts carry over for some a certain amount of time too, right? Uh, yes.
(6:25:48) So, typically any general contractor or retail group will do anywhere between 300 to $500 uh,000 a year with us and they typically will just stay with us uh for like five years. Amazing. Well, this is why it makes sense to, you know, if you're okay doing the matching up front. My only recommendation on the matching up front, I think you do the matching up front if the if your cost structure works, but I would offer to sell the some kind of like, hey, 5year warranty that doesn't kick in until year two that they can buy that you can advertise over the next four years. And as long as it's delayed over the term, you're going to get a lot
(6:26:24) more buyers for it. I actually did try that. So, I didn't match last year and I made less sales, but I had like 10% higher margins. This year, I started matching and my margins went down 10%. Um, and like the only new clients I've gotten is from like uh the referrals. Yeah.
(6:26:51) So, like, yeah, I've seen my local competitor who's sitting in the market for about 30 years and I've been able to calculate their margins and they're down to 30. So, I have like if I keep matching, I will be pushed down to that level. Of course. Okay. I I um I I think you I think you hit the nail on the head.
(6:27:09) If you you match to start getting people in the door, especially if you're you know losing market share, so you match a little bit if your cost structure works. I would love if you didn't have to match. Um a lot of times I offer to folks that if they are matching, match the first year and then reset to the market on the second year because you can say, "Hey, I'll match it on the first year. I know you like working with me.
(6:27:27) um I want to make sure that the there's no delta in the first year for you and then we'll earn your business in the year or two. Most people are like wait there she's giving in which which feels pretty good. Um okay um that's one but as soon as you I would love for more a value prop based analysis maybe a loom video or this this little AI graph that alone will give you a way to stand out which I I'm pretty sure your competitors are not doing right now. I'm pretty sure as well.
(6:27:48) Yeah, this has been super super helpful. Um, the only other question I have is on how to generate more qualified leads, if we have time to run over that. Yeah, let's let's do it really quick. So, what how where where are you you're getting mainly from referrals right now? Um, so I get two to five leads from referrals.
(6:28:15) Um, I have a marketing spend of about 40,000 uh per year and I get like five clients per year. Okay. So, it's not like high numbers volume is too low, right? Um, do the current referral sources that you have, do they have the ability to refer you more? I believe so, but they I don't think my referral bonus really incentivizes them because they usually will send the referral before I even like mention the amount of the bonus. Right.
(6:28:48) Right. Um, what And is the bonus? You don't have to tell me what it is, but is the bonus material or is it a token? Say again. $5,000. Oh, I mean that's that's for making an introduction. That's not bad, right? I would think it's not bad. Yeah. Yeah. Um and and who who are these referral sources? Where who exactly are they? Um previous clients.
(6:29:12) to like one client who in their network has other GCs or other capital groups that they just know they like, hey, I used this person, they did a good job. Um, and they'll refer me even before like I tell them how much they'll get, you know. Yeah. Um, have you had a chance to go to the existing client base and uh discuss or promote the referral bonus idea or is it only as and when it happens? Um I have gone through my whole list and like talked to them about the referral bonuses. We're like everyone I've spoken to them about that um in particular.
(6:29:47) Got it. Um is there a way to ex So I'll is there a way to explain to new kind of capital groups etc as to you can just pitch directly the referral bonus only? So is there a way to walk in and say hey here's what I do. I'm not looking for your business but as you see this here's how we serve our clients.
(6:30:10) Can you create referral only partnerships? That is a good idea. We have done that with people who work with capital groups and work with general contractors, but we haven't done that with GC's and capital groups themselves yet. Um, last question on this one. Is there a way to throw like a GC event? There is, but I wouldn't know what would actually bring them in. Huh. I don't know what value to offer them.
(6:30:35) That may be that may be worth cracking because if they can look to you as a you know what would this person appreciate to turn around and become a referral source. I mean that may be something to crack. Yeah, there's actually someone in uh the school group chat that runs these events. Maybe I will Oh, Even better. Even better. Yeah. Awesome. Well, try that.
(6:30:58) And if you um if you make one of those cool charts, please uh send it to us because we'd love to see it, too. Sound good. um in the school group, let me know where to send it or I'll just post it there. Yeah, just post it. Yeah, post it so everyone can see it. Awesome. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. Thank you for Thank you for donating books. Thank you for helping entrepreneurs. We appreciate you.
(6:31:14) Well, you're so welcome. Have a great day, y'all. You, too. Bye. All right, y'all. It is time. It's two o'clock. So, uh Mike, can you put a uh a threem minute timer up because I'm gonna I'm just going to wrap this up. Um I do want to say thank you guys so much. um the launch blueprint. Um everyone who buys while this is live uh will get it and then it's uh it's gone again.
(6:31:40) So uh yeah, if you were watching and felt like doing that, that'd be great. Um I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. Uh super excited about that. Um and uh for I know I just saw some people like I just came in. I'll just do I'll do the world's shortest recap for anybody who's new. Um, so the whole point of this launch was to get people to donate as many books as possible.
(6:32:05) You heard a lot of the stories of people who were like, "Hey, I read your books and I was able to start my business or grow my business or it got me out of debt or whatever." And and and I mean books is something that's changed my life. And um I've been a writer for most of my life. A lot of guys don't know that, but I I was the editor-in chief of my of the literary magazine. I was vice editor of the newspaper when I was in high school.
(6:32:24) Um I got a writing scholarship. Um, and so I actually really do enjoy writing. And so I spent the last two years basically writing these for you guys, um, and taking a thousand plus, you know, businesses and trying to document every single thing that they had wrong with them and then trying to create specific playbooks to help them solve it.
(6:32:48) And the whole purpose of that was to incentivize business owners to donate as many books as possible um, to help more entrepreneurs. And I see that as just kind of this self-licking ice cream cone that compounds over time. So that's why this whole book drive and this whole donation drive worked that way. um for those of you who are curious. All right, that being said, there's four systems that basically ladder up to the four biggest constraints that we found. One is leads. So there's four big problems in leads.
(6:33:04) It's like you have an ads issue, you've got a hooks issue, you got a branding issue, you got a marketing m issue, which is an operational issue. The lead system you get for free all four playbooks when you donate 200 bucks. The sales system has lead nurture, closing, and proof, which basically ladder up to get them to schedule, get them to show, get them to close once they do, and get them to close faster and at higher prices with proof checklist.
(6:33:22) All three of those playbooks are also free when you donate 200 bucks. These are all hard copies, by the way. There's nothing digital. Um, delivery, which is going to be LTV and retention. Get them to pay longer and get them to spend more money on it. So, that is also free when you donate 200 bucks.
(6:33:39) And then, uh, the last of the the four systems is the profit implementation system. It's the big thing here is that we found is that um, a lot of people mispriced. And so, it's either they're not soliciting their existing customers long enough um, or they're just not charging enough for what they do. And like they're doing everything else right, they're just not doing that.
(6:33:56) And these three playbooks basically break down specifically okay we're not soliciting our existing customers enough which is what the fast cash calendar fast cash checklist is for. Uh pricing is just overarching like how do we position our pricing such that I thought I was going to do it in three minutes but maybe give me like another minute.
(6:34:13) Um uh and then price playbook is basically how do you communicate a widespread change to an existing customer base that will ultimately allow you to charge more. It's one of the I want to say easiest, it's most it's one of the gutsiest things that you can do in the business, but also I read you a bunch of stories of people who did it and it like made a huge difference in their lives. All right, so those are the four systems. You get all of those free when you donate 200 bucks.
(6:34:29) Um, I also did 226 one-on-one consultations. So, people paid $135,000 to have me individually consult their business. And the main purpose of that was I spent two years doing this. I showed you some of the pictures of every one of the days of basically breaking down all these businesses and I would just deliver them all in one day.
(6:34:46) Um, and so this is literally all the notes from two years. This was like an unbelievable amount of work. And I did this so that I could train the AI on how to apply the playbooks to any type of business across industries. And so I named a whole bunch of them. Your your business is probably included in one of the businesses that I worked with or more than one.
(6:35:02) And so that's what the AI was there for was to help you apply it. And then um the HQ implementation workshop, we charge $35,000 uh in person for this. I will be leading uh you through it for free if you also donate 200 bucks. And the main outcome of this is that you can figure out which one of these to apply and how to use the tool.
(6:35:20) That's kind of how I see this is like how do I use the tool as best way possible um with skill which is like we use this tool internally as well. Okay. So you'll get all four of the systems lead system, sales system, delivery system, profit system free. You get the AI free you get the HQ virtual implementation shop workshop free. And while the live stream is on, which All right, give me give me 45 seconds.
(6:35:43) Sorry. All right. Thank you. All right. Um, and then you'll get the live uh the launch blueprint. Um, sorry if my adrenals are just shot at this point. All right. But you'll get the live the launch blueprint for free, which includes everything that we did to launch uh this Guinness World Record-breaking launch.
(6:36:04) So, the emails, the texts, the the VSSL scripts, um the internal memos, all 1700 slides that that you guys saw today, which if you want to just model it. It's one of the easiest things to do. Just copy it and then, you know, put in the pieces that you want to just replace with whatever you sell. Um all of that, uh this comes free, but this comes down in All right.
(6:36:21) Give them give them like I like talking to him. Okay. Give it three four minutes. Four minutes. That's it. That's it. That's the last one. Okay. So, um, do that. Uh, all of those are free. Uh, when you donate 200 bucks, uh, just logistics for you, uh, you'll get a code. So, you'll actually get, this is what you'll actually get in the mail. All right? Just so you can understand.
(6:36:43) So, you're going to get a box that looks like this. Okay? Inside of it, you'll have a binder like this that'll have all 12 uh, playbooks inside of it. And so, you'll be able to, you know, put them in there. And then on top of that, you'll have the money models book. And some of you guys also got the ACQ handbooks for advertising and uh sales.
(6:37:09) And so you'll also have those in there if you chose to uh add 15 more books, I think, to the order, something like that. Um and so that's what's inside of this box that you'll get in the mail. Now, the things that you'll get access to digitally is that you'll get uh the login for this so that you can actually use the AI. Um people are already using it.
(6:37:25) I shared some of the stories. People very excited about it. Um, on top of that, you'll get the details about how to attend the ACU virtual workshop. And this one will come after the launch is over on Tuesday morning. Okay? Um, and the reason for that is because, and this is digital because we're literally still making it. And the reason it's Tuesday morning is because the launch's over.
(6:37:42) It's not over yet. And so I couldn't send you something that we hadn't finished yet. And so that's why this comes later. Okay. So, um, you guys have 2 minutes and 53 seconds. Um, so if you've been like, "Hey, I want to do it. Do it now." Um, all the launch collateral uh will come down when the live stream is off.
(6:38:04) And I'm pretty sure this is the last live stream that I'm going to do um before the before the car closes. So, um just want to say thank you guys so much. Hope you guys enjoyed Hotline. Um and uh can I give a little shout out to my man Chiron for like for for filling in so that I can like pee. Um, but you guys are awesome and uh we wouldn't have been able to do this record um without you guys.
(6:38:29) And I I feel almost weird saying it's like our record cuz I kind of just see it like as an entrepreneur record. Um I just feel like there should be one entrepreneur on the list for non-fiction, you know, since we're the ones paying everyone else's taxes. Anyways, um so anyways, thank you guys so much. It's been a true honor. Um I put a huge amount of work into this. I'm very confident that you will get value from it. Um and fundamentally it's because like these are the things we do.
(6:38:47) These aren't theories. we know they work. Um, as long as you work them. Again, it's not a promise or a guarantee. Everyone's a little bit personalized, which is why why I spent so much time trying to make this as good as I as good as I reliably could. Um, and yeah, so it's been good. It's been a ride.
(6:39:06) So, a minute a minute 38. You guys can finish your checkouts. I I'll I'll I'll go down with the I will I will stay on till the last second with you guys. Um, it's funny because I tell a lot of the stories um of how like each one of these each one of these playbooks um I'll tell you some of the stories that that like I learned in order to figure out these pieces and I would get stuck um trying to make this work. You know, like the the the story I told you about the closing playbook is is real.
(6:39:35) Like uh when I was flying around the country doing gym launches, I had um like if if a guy couldn't close, I would lose like a huge amount of money. And so I would like have to fly out and like retrain them as quickly as possible. And so I got good at sales training because I had to.
(6:39:53) Um, and like the fast cash uh playbook that I said like I learned that because Sam, the the guy that I joined the gym owner group with, he was like, "Hey man, just send this email to your list." And I was like, "What does it do?" And he's like, "Just send it." And I was like, "Okay." And so it was Big Booty Boot Camp. And it was the first thing I ever did that was like a an immediate upsell to my existing customer base.
(6:40:10) And it ended up paying my rent for like two months. And it was like very meaningful for me. And so I was like, "Oh man, what if I did like more of these and did more often rotate them." Then it became Big Booty Boot Camp and Holiday Hangover and, you know, spring like accountability buddies and I was just like sexy, you know, buns and guns and like I did everything I could to to come up with these different plays and then I came up with a system around it.
(6:40:29) And so anyways, you get all this stuff free when you donate 200 bucks. Live stream offer comes down in 12 seconds. So um that's going to cut off in the Shopify store momentarily. Um, otherwise the other stuff is done until the launch is up, but the live stream bonus ends right now. So, thank you guys so much. I appreciate you guys. And, um, I love you. All right. Bye.
(6:40:49) [Applause]

$100M Money Models Live Launch - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_CCutkM11g

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm Alexi and welcome to my $100 million Money Models book launch event and we're going to try and break not one but two world records together here live. So, I've got the Guinness judges right here. Britney, I want you to come on out. Britney's going to make sure that we check boxes and do the things to uh make this legit. Thank you so much, Britney. We all Thank you.
(00:27) Um so, it's going to be a wild ride. Uh, and you guys are going to want to buckle up because it's gonna get exciting. Now, if you're anything like me, you know that businesses need money to grow. So, I'm going to show you the art of getting more customers to spend more money in less time again and again.
(00:46) But, I want to warn you, this isn't a promise you're become rich, fabulous, or fabulously rich or get any other result. Everyone is different. Scaling your business, like everything else in life worth doing, involves risk. And most people do nothing at all. So, your results will vary. So, if you see text like this at the bottom of the screen, it's there to remind you of that fact.
(01:04) And that's why I make free content every day to help you, the entrepreneur, to scale your business and make your results as good as I reliably can. And in the spirit of that, this is the biggest free book launch event to help entrepreneurs and business owners I've ever put on, and maybe the biggest one in history. We'll see. But I'm no saint.
(01:23) I want to make money just like you. And I do all this so I can someday invest in your company and scale it because scaling companies like yours by installing new money models is how I make my money. Just to give you an idea, let me tell you something insane. I sold three companies I started as a kid. Two of them at $46.
(01:43) 2 million in an allcash deal to American Pacific Group. And then I took that money and invested it in new companies which I've since scaled under our holding company Acquisition.com. For context, the businesses in Acquisition.com portfolio did in aggregate over $250 million in revenue in 2024. To give you an idea, if Acquisition.
(02:01) com were a publicly traded company today, it'd be in the top 15% of all 51,000 publicly traded companies when we use net income as a measuring stick. So me saying this may create envy in some, anger in others, skepticism in most, and confusion in old people, inspire a select few. And you, the entrepreneur, the business owner, are who I made these money models for.
(02:27) It's also why my wife and I made it our mission to make real business education accessible for everyone. Cool. Great. Now you're all caught up. But you're not here for my story. You're here to take the next step in yours. So here's what I'll show you today. how good money models get more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again.
(02:45) And when that happens, your business scales as fast as you can handle. That said, money models work for marketing agencies, online businesses, real estate, financial services, insurance, home services, local business, consumer services, automotive, healthcare, software, e-learning, e-commerce, and anything that sells stuff to anyone.
(03:02) And I know they work because of two inarguable truths. One, I know they work because I use them in our portfolio companies today, which include financial services, business services, consumer services, local businesses, software, e-commerce, and more. And two, no matter how complex a money model looks, there's only four types of stuff you can sell.
(03:20) Software, information, services, and physical products. And money models work in all of them, which if your business sells stuff, includes yours. So, I've used money models my whole life. They got me to where I am. Everything I've accomplished, I have a money model to thank for it. So, I know this works from experience and not theory.
(03:43) So, I'm going to deliver for two types of people today. Number one, the up andcoming entrepreneurs need to put on your oxygen mask and take care of yourself and your family first. I promise you, I will help you get closer to that today for free. Period. So, you're going to want to stay until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time. You have my word.
(04:00) And then second, the business owners, the players, the money makers. I'm going to make it in your best interest to help me help everyone else. And if you decide to join me, I'll show you how we can accomplish both our goals together. So, here's what we're going to cover in our short time together today. Number one, what you're going to get from being here.
(04:19) Number two, what kills 82% of businesses. As much as I'd love to say it's lack of hard work, it's not that. Number three, the one thing that makes a business impossible to kill. and number four, how to apply it to your business today. So, let's start with the first, what you're gonna get for being here. So, let's start by addressing the elephant in the room.
(04:39) Am I really going to give everyone here who's live a secret project I've been working on for four years that's better than an NFT and less than a Bitcoin? Yes, a thousand% yes. And every single person here live today will get one for free. But I can't tell you what it is yet. You'll have to stay and find out. But just so you know, it's legit. This is something that I will sell. And at the end of this live stream, I'll tell you how to get it for free.
(05:03) So, watch out for that. Now, to the main event. I'd never expect you to take my word for how powerful money models are. I want to prove it to you. So, without further ado, $100 million money models, how to make money. So, let me explain. I'm a big believer in proof. Anyone can make promises. Very few people have proof. And every book I've written to this point, I kept proof front and center.
(05:31) To do that, I make sure each of my books walks their talk. So they not only tell you what to do, but they also prove what amazing things can happen if you do it. For offers, I posted and ghosted. No fanfare, no launch, no nothing. But the book answered the question, "What do I sell?" Answer: Offer so good people feel stupid saying no.
(05:53) It proved it could answer that question by demonstrating the concept it outlined, creating a grand slam offer. It had a rock bottom introductory price. It included a free course with higher quality stuff than most people's paid stuff with no strings attached, not even an opt-in. Truly available to anyone and everyone. It was high value.
(06:11) $100 million offers has what I describe as a high price to value discrepancy. In other words, you got way more than you paid for. So, $100 million offers grown word of mouth. Those are the actual sales. And four years later, it's still a bestseller across multiple categories.
(06:29) That's as of August 25 with 26,000 five-star reviews, which today millions have watched, read, or listen to. All of this undeniable proof that the ideas, principles, and tactics work. And so, after releasing that book in July of 2021, I immediately got to work on my next book to answer the next question. Who do I sell my offer to? answer.
(06:49) Leads, aka the strangers who want to buy your stuff. But there was a problem. I'd successfully advertised my whole life, but I just didn't have enough proof in modern-day social media. So, I used the next 24 months for one thing, proof. Proof that the stuff that I show in $100 million leads actually works to get leads today in the real world and it could work for you, too.
(07:09) So, I applied only the principles and tactics and $100 million leads to grow my audience from just a handful of customers and friends to over 5 million plus people. And so, this is where I started on YouTube. This was 24 months later. This is where I started my podcast. This 24 months later, but the point is this.
(07:25) This massive growth resulted in 463,167 registrations for the leads launch and breaking the internet. All through direct application of the $100 million leads principles, proving you can use them to advertise anything to anyone at scale. And two years later, thanks to $100 leads, I've gone from 5 million person audience to a 13 plus person audience again.
(07:52) So I use all the principles in this book because they clearly still work. So not only did my own growth prove the book worked, but the mega launch made it undeniable. But something was still missing. Because even if you have the thing to sell offers and the people to sell it to leads, you still have another question to answer.
(08:17) How do you get them to give you money and ideally as much as possible as as fast as possible over and over again? Answer: I want a $100 million money model. But like the other two books, I still needed proof. a way to prove the concepts inside the book undeniably work. So, here's my undeniable proof $100 million money models work. We've sold more books before this launch than we sold in the entire launch last time.
(08:47) And we haven't even released it yet. So, now you know I won't publish a book until the book itself serves as its own undeniable proof. That way, you don't have to guess if it's going to work. You can know. And if you wanted even more proof, Judge Britney, how how many people do we peek out so far? 113,000. 113,000.
(09:11) Not bad. So, if proof that installing a $100 million money model into a business can help it generate more cash flow is what you're going to get here today, the next thing to figure out is how to scale it.
(09:29) But instead of asking how do we scale a business to get the most efficient answer we can use what Uncle Charlie taught us inversion and ask how do we kill one? So that's what we'll cover next. What kills 82% of businesses. So when we ask how do we kill a business besides giving up? Obviously there's only one thing. You run out of money. According to a study by US Bank, a source I trust given they have billions of dollars on the line, 82% of businesses fail due to poor cash flow, said differently, "If you've got no money, you've got no business.
(09:59) You can't even pay annual filing fees to keep your business open without money." So, here's something you probably didn't know. What percent of B businesses do you think lose money every year? 10%. 15% 18%. Not even close. Try three times that. According to the Federal Reserve, 54% of businesses lose money or break even every year.
(10:23) That means you work 80our weeks year round to miss restful weekends, holidays, school plays, family dinners, birthdays, nights out, all to take on more risk than any person reasonably should and end up poor than you started. And it shouldn't be that way. But then you might think, well, the other 46% must be balling. Guess again.
(10:44) Of the 46% that make any money at all, what do you think they're taking home? Well, if you listen to Instagram, you think everyone's a millionaire, obviously. Nope. What about 250 grand a year? 100 grand a year? 74,000 a year? Just the median income of US household? Nope. According to the 2024 Census Bureau data, the median income listed on tax returns for a business owner is, drum roll please, $48,000 a year. just a fraction more than San Francisco's minimum wage.
(11:18) All to get sued, stolen from, and called the bad guy for trying to make it on your own. And that's a problem. And that's what I'm going to help solve today. And even if you're doing well, everything I'm about to share will just help you scale faster. All right. Now, all of this together tells us one thing.
(11:37) If you own a business, then at some point, no matter how hard you work, you'll likely have times where you lose money trying to get and serve new customers. In other words, you spend more money on customers than they spend on you. That's a big problem because if you do that long enough, your business will die. Which brings us to point three. The one thing that makes a business impossible to kill. So, we've hit a fork in the road.
(11:57) Either option one, be like most businesses and be limited by cash flow to grow. Or option two, get paid a lot fast on repeat and grow as much as you darn well please. A $100 million money model is option two. $100 million money models use a big fancy equation that looks like this, which says 30-day gross profit is greater than two times cost of acquiring customer plus cost of goods sold or CAC plus COGS.
(12:22) And that's big and fancy, but in the real world, it just starts with an offer. An offer is a problem you solve for customers in exchange for money. A money model is a sequence of offers. A $100 million money model is a sequence of offers that make customers spend twice as much on you as you do on them in 30 days or less.
(12:46) And when you do that, you remove cash as a limiter for growth. To do this, $100 money models use four powerful mechanisms. Attraction offers, which get people to buy, which means more cash up front. Upsell offers, which get them to spend more, which means even more cash up front.
(13:05) downell offers, which get them to buy something if they say no, which results in more cash upfront, or continuity offers, which get them to buy repeatedly, which results in more cash over time. End result, more cash flow from more customers in less time. A $100 million money model. And cash flow is the key. It's the only thing that guarantees you can stay in business. So, let me prove it to you.
(13:29) What do JP Morgan, GE, Ford, AMX, Coca-Cola, 3M all have in common? They're all over a hundred years old, which they could only get to by surviving the hardest times and biggest economic shifts in modern history. Things that killed most businesses. They survived World War I, World War II, the Great Depression, the advent of the radio, the advent of the television, the advent of the computer, the aven of social media.
(13:58) And they were only able to survive because they had cash flow, because they had a better money model. In other words, they kept making money. So if they could survive all that, then it shows us good money models make bad leads, bad customers, bad reviews, bad hires, bad lawsuits, bad economies, and everything else that kills businesses like yours and mine a walk in the park.
(14:21) said differently, "Many business owners do everything right except for the one thing that keeps businesses going and growing, making money." In other words, they've got broken money models, which makes all their focus on everything else in their business the same as obsessing over the aerodynamics of a car when in reality, the engine doesn't even start.
(14:45) So, if cash flow is the most important thing and a money model is the most powerful way to increase it, how do we make a good one? Well, you build a hundred million $100 million money model. So, here's what it looks like when it's right. If you make more offers and more people buy them, you make more money.
(15:05) If you make more money, you can use it to get more customers. If that money comes faster, the faster you can get even more customers. But what if you make your customers twice as valuable? You get twice as many of them, and they pay you at twice the speed. Answer: Your business grows eight times as fast. But what if you make your customers three times as valuable, get three times as many of them, and they pay you at three times the speed? Your business grows 27 times as fast.
(15:37) A $100 million money model is how my gym scaled from zero to six locations in three years as a 22-year-old. It's how Jim Launch, my second company, scaled from 380,000 a month to 2.2 million a month in 12 months. It's how Prestige Labs, my third company, went from 270,000 a month to 1.6 million a month in 6 months. A $100 million money model is how Allen, my fourth company, went from 50,000 a month to 1.3 million a month in 6 months.
(16:01) And this was all before I had a personal brand. With a $100 million money model, you can get really big, really profitable really fast without starting with loads of money or followers and all with just a few tweaks. And that's the concept I'll illustrate the rest of our time together.
(16:21) That being said, let me show you what happens to a normal business when you add in a $100 million money model. So that what makes that's what makes a business impossible to kill. Now we get into applying it to your business today. So the purpose of this section is to show you two things. Number one, money model mechanisms work for any business because there's only four ways to sell and they work in all of them. And then second, one money model mechanism is all you need to get amazing results.
(16:46) So before you think to yourself, I'm not sure this concept applies to my business, which I call special snowflake itis. And you should get that looked at. There's only four ways to sell stuff. You have in person, you have online, you've got with the salesman, and you've got selfch checkckout or on your own, which then give us salesman in person, salesman online, selfch checkckout in person, selfch checkout online.
(17:12) So, really quickly, identify which one you are. Number one, number two, number three, or number four. Can you drop this in the chat? One, two, three, or four. Which one you are right now? Drop it in. All right. Great. ones, twos, threes, fours. There we go. All right. Which means that your business can scale using a money model. So that's number one. Check.
(17:37) Now we move on to number two. One money model mechanism is all you need to get amazing results. As a reminder, here are the four. Attraction offers, which get people to buy. Upsell offers, which get them to buy more. Downell offers, which get them to buy something if they say no.
(17:55) or continuity offers which get them to buy repeatedly. Now, let me prove it to you in the real world. Let's break down a consumer service money model with a salesman in person. So, if you sell in person, put one in the chat. I saw a bunch of the ones. This is for you guys. All right, inerson sales people, inerson business owners, this is for you.
(18:14) Now, let me tell you about my first good money model. My gym grew because I changed my attraction offer to get new customers. So, here's most gyms bad money model. So, they do a free trial into a gym membership. So, here's how that works. So, they spend a hundred bucks to get one free trial. It takes three trials to get one $100 per month paying member, which means it costs $300 per paid member who pays $100 a month, which means it takes three months to break even. But many members quit in four.
(18:44) So, here's how $100 million money model fixed it. This is my $100 million gym money model. Win your money back into gym membership. So, I spend the same $100 to get a customer instead of a trial. The customer spends $500 upfront with a win your money back offer, which works like this. You set a goal for the customer and tell them how to reach it.
(19:07) If they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or get it back as store credit. After they win their money back as store credit, I make a special continuity offer to get them to buy again. result. I make way more cash flow than the bad model within 30 days. The cash let me scale to six locations in three years as a kid in my 20s.
(19:27) The money model works so well I could fill new locations with paying members before they opened. I went from sleeping on the floor to six-pack locations and then eventually licensed the model to thousands of gyms. But here's the bottom line. Both gyms, the free trial gym or the win your moneyback gym, deliver the same service, use the same equipment, have access to the same trainers, sell the same types of memberships, but one makes way more, the one with the better money model. So, there might not be anything wrong with your business. You might just have
(19:59) something wrong with your money model. So, that was a consumer service money model with the salesman in person. This time we'll do a B2B service money model with a salesman online. So that includes DMs, uh DM selling, uh email selling, uh phone sales, Zoom sales, any other digital sales that you have a salesperson behind it, getting people to buy stuff.
(20:22) So let me tell you about my second $100 million money model. So if you do sell online or over the phone, put a two in the chat because this one's for you. All right. All right. Yeah, we got a lot of twos. All right. Heard. So, Gym Launch got customers easily because my attraction offer worked. But getting people to buy continuity was hard.
(20:42) They had no reason to buy my next thing once I'd already gotten them tons of leads. So, here was my mediocre money model. I sold a $16,000 launch package. That's it. So, I spent money get them on the phone. It took three calls to sell a new customer, but then they wouldn't buy my next continuity offer. So, they'd leave and I would be sad. So every week I had to start from zero to make payroll. Stressful.
(21:07) And so here's how $100 million Money Model fixed it. On one sales call, I desperately needed to close. And so I unknowingly made a new offer that I now call a continuity bonus offer. So here's how it works. You give the customer an awesome thing for free if they join continuity. Typically the bonus itself has more value than the first payment. And it crushed.
(21:29) So people started taking my continuity bonus offer and instead of leaving they bought something at three times the price and so my continuity started stacking and stacking. You can see the exact moment I nail the money model right there.
(21:48) Like you can see it was kind of flat and then boom and then we went from 380,000 a month to 1.76 million in six months. And this is how I filled up a room like this with people paying $42,000 a year. And then 12 weeks later, a room like this. And then a quarter or so later, a room like this. And then a quarter or so after that, a room like this. Look at the timeline between the pictures.
(22:12) December of 17, March of 18, August of 18, February of 19. We scaled big fast in a small niche and beat our competition and then sold a private equity. And the main reason is this. Just look at the numbers. The difference the continuity offer made to LTV was huge. You can see it in the purple at the bottom. Imagine changing your offer mechanism and seeing that kind of increase without it costing you any more to get customers. The key point is this.
(22:43) We sold the same stuff in both scenarios, the same core service, but a better money model changed the business. And once I nailed my continuity bonus mechanism, Jim's bought and stuck. but they didn't have my entire money model down. That led me to my next $100 million money model. So, that was a B2B service business with online sales.
(23:07) This time, we'll do a business to consumer business with a selfch checkckout in person. Right? So, if you sell people where they check out in person, drop a three in the chat. This is especially for my retail folks. All right. So, I had all these gyms relying on me. ad costs were going up and they needed more money to afford ads or they stopped getting customers. The kiss of death for them and me.
(23:31) So to cover my ad costs in my gyms, I upsold supplements. That's how I could outspend my competition. So I figured I'd teach gyms to upsell supplements. That makes sense. And I figured if I was going to do that, then they might as well be mine. And so Prestige Labs was born. So gyms bought in, but their customers weren't buying from them. A problem.
(23:50) So, it was only after I taught my four-part menu upsell mechanism where you unsell what they don't need, prescribe what they do need, ask if they prefer A or B, then make it easy to pay that it started working and customers started buying. Sales went from 270,000 a month. Watch this one to 1.
(24:13) 6 million a month in two months, eight weeks. You can see the moment when the menu upsell kicked in. And I'm not saying this is going to happen for you. That's not my point here, but I'm saying that when you can nail the money model, it can change everything. And so once they had a better money model, it all clicked. And the key point is this.
(24:32) They literally sold the same product, the same exact jars of protein and preworkouts. They sold the same thing, but with a better money model, they made more money. And now with my menu upsell offer mechanism, gyms could afford leads again. And during COVID, having the supplement revenue line kept many lights on and households fed.
(24:56) We demonstrated that despite going through hard times, which co for gyms was very hard, a $100 million money model could still generate strong cash flow. And that's one of the only reasons I was able to sell a gym company to private equity during COVID. Think about that. So, that was an in-person selfch checkckout money model. This time we'll do an online checkout money model.
(25:20) So if you sell through online checkout, drop a four in the chat. So that's you know someone buys whether it's software, information, physical product, whatever it is that they can click and then buy. All right, we got some fours. We got some fours. All right, sweet. So after I taken out distributions and gotten paid from the sale of both companies, I started making content to attract companies to ACQ and waited for my next big money model. And that's when school came along.
(25:46) School's a platform that helps anyone build monetizable communities online. You can live stream one to many, host client calls, have inerson meetups, have one-time sales, host competitions, have unlimited pricing tiers, create lifetime deals, free trials, free groups, paid groups, private groups, process payments, all in one place. But here was the money model when we started.
(26:05) 14 days free, then $99 a month. School grew with free trials, hit a million users, but it took three years. So, we made a new attraction offer. We added the school games which had competition, rewards, and fun. And users exploded. We went from 1 million users to 15 plus million users in 18 months. That's 83,000 new users a month to 775,000 new users a month.
(26:34) That's three and a half times faster growth. Just look at the difference between these two graphs. And here's the best part. This new money model made school cash flow positive. Completely unheard of for a platform at this scale growing this fast. It freed up cash to invest even more into the product and make school 10 times better.
(26:58) So that takes us up to present day and shows that money models work in all four ways to sell, including the way you sell, and shows us one of each attraction, upsell, downell, and continuity offer mechanisms. And normally that would be enough, but we're all here. So that brings me to my last $100 million money model, the book launch event itself, which is one of these. And number four, selfch checkckout online.
(27:28) A free book launch like this costs millions to put on and let everyone know so they can show up also costs millions. But instead of losing millions, I built a money model that used pre-orders with various money model mechanisms to both make this event free and have the funds to let everyone know about it.
(27:46) So let me show you what we did to demonstrate the ideas of the book with the book. So, instead of just releasing a book, we offered a free event. Y'all are here now. Plus, for anyone who registered, we offered VIP status if you pre-ordered by offering you more value for the same price than if you waited. Way more value. Lots and lots more value.
(28:10) This is called a pay less now or pay more later mechanism. After that, I offer two hard copies of my ACQ handbooks free if you bought 15 more copies, which is a buy X, get Y free offer, which I use in at least seven different ways. More on that later. So, here's what happened. Day one, I spent $22,000 and got $34,000 back.
(28:35) Day two, I spent $26,000 and got $38,000 back. Day three, I spent $21,000 and got $49,000 back. But here's the important part. On top of that, we got 13,184 folks to find out about this event for free. So, we just kept doubling down using house money to scale this all the way up. And so, the bottom line is this. We spent four million plus dollars on advertising and got 6.
(29:05) 47 whatever 6 point whatever 6 and a.5 million back. So, even though this cost millions to do, I didn't need millions to do it. And this is like this is the key point here. Look at the beginning spend. I didn't drop $4 million day one. As long as you can make more back and keep recycling it through, that's what makes this magical. All I needed was a $100 million money model. After that, the launch funds itself.
(29:33) Once a money model works, it's kind of like playing with house money at the casino, right? This is how I scaled my gyms fast, even though I started at 22 with very little. This is how when I lost everything twice, I was able to get it back so fast. You just need enough to get that first customer. And then after that, you double down.
(29:52) You set up a $100 million money model to create cash flow to grow, and then get out of the way because there's only four ways to sell stuff, and money models work in all four. And when you build a business with a $100 money model, you can spend as much as you want to get people to find out about your stuff because you have the cash flow to do it if you do it well.
(30:10) Of course, it takes skill and time. My results are from both. Yours will differ, right? But given the size of this event now, you know it works at any scale in any industry at any price. So, as long as a business sells something, there's a money model that scales it. That's how powerful it is. Yes. including your business. You who are here with me right now.
(30:32) These are the skills that have been most valuable in my life. So, if you're anything like me, they're definitely skills worth learning, and I want to transfer them to you to the best of my ability. So, here's what we covered so far. Cash flow is the only thing a business needs to survive.
(30:49) If each customer pays for two more, you remove cash as a limiter for growth. A $100 million money model is a sequence of offers engineered to get customers to pay for two more. The four money model mechanisms are attraction, upsell, downell, and continuity. There's only four ways to sell stuff.
(31:09) Online, selfch checkckout, online with salesperson, in person with selfch checkckout, in person with a salesperson. 100 million money models work for all businesses. Brickandmortar, B2B, consumer services, online businesses, SAS, and physical products. and what 100 million money models made its own launch profitable using its own concepts before it was even released. Can you see how a better money model getting more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again can unlock the growth you want? Can you see how having a better money model helps you grow on your own without taking on bad debts, lame investors, or terrible partners? Can you see how a
(31:43) stronger money model can help you weather the bad storms, bad hires, and inevitable bad economies to come? Can you see how mastering money models can change your entire business or life without changing your product or delivery? Can you see how your business, big or small, online or in person, with salespeople or without, can use 100 money model to scale? In short, can you see why building the best money model possible is a skill worth having? And this skill may just be the bridge between where you are and wherever you want to go. At least it has been for me.
(32:16) So, let me ask you a question. Who here would like to master this skill? If so, drop a rocket in the chat. It's a rocket emoji, if you will. Thank you for spelling spelling rocket out. Yes, for dropping rocket in the chat. Great. Now, to be clear, people don't fly out to my headquarters or ask us to invest in their business because they think I understand HVAC, plumbing, insurance, lawn care, coding, hair saloning, legaling, or their business in any way better than them.
(32:49) They come because I understand the mechanisms of making money and how to combine them in the right order. In other words, they come because I know how to build money models. So, the result of implementing these skills every day for more than 13 years, the best of what I know about generating hundreds of millions a year through acquisition.com. What took me from gym floor to doing very cool stuff like this.
(33:12) It's with great pride that I introduced to you the $100 money model system. With this system, you have the opportunity to wield, chain, stack, and combine all 15 money model mechanisms with devastating effect. With the $100 million money model system, you can learn to master monetization.
(33:31) You'll have access to the tools that I personally use to transform businesses like yours and mine into cash flow machines. To have the cash flows to buy yourself the time, the talent, and the advertising to scale. 100% money is the most how-to system I've ever made. And judging by the world record we just unofficially broke in the beginning, possibly ever made. So, here's the first thing you get in the $100 money model system.
(33:56) Convert strangers into first-time buyers with attraction accelerator. If you're someone who doesn't get enough replies or optins, or your web pages don't convert, or people don't trust you enough to buy from your content, or your leads just cost too much, then pay attention. This is for you.
(34:14) So, remember how I scaled to six locations? I was able to do that with just one attraction offer mechanism. So, here's what they are. An attraction offer is something free or discounted that gets a customer in the door but makes money by getting them to buy something better at a higher price. So, here's why they matter.
(34:31) Without attraction offers, you're stuck competing on price or hoping people randomly find you, which keeps you struggling to grow and scrambling to find customers. So, here's why doing them right is important. Done wrong, you lose money on every customer and go out of business. Done right, customers pay you more than it costs to get them on day one, giving you unlimited growth potential.
(34:50) So, here's what's inside my five most unique and increasingly powerful attraction mechanisms. Number one, win your money back. With this reverse psychology method, customers pay you full price and then work like maniacs to win their money back. This backwards approach gets insane results, reviews, and referrals. Attraction mechanism number two, giveaways.
(35:11) It's a 7-day formula that puts strangers into buy mode within a week. and using grand prizes the specific way I'll show you floods your business with people who already want your most expensive stuff and are pre-qualified to buy it. Number three, a dummy offer that gets customers to ignore your cheap stuff because they like your expensive stuff even more even though it costs way more than expected.
(35:33) This attraction mechanism makes expensive feel cheap and turns browsers into buyers. Number four, buy X get Y free. a quantity multiplier that gets customers to buy way more than they planned and thank you for it. This attraction mechanisms turns discount offers into irresistible free offers that get people to buy higher quantities of stuff or months of service on the spot. Number five, pay less now or pay more later.
(35:58) A speed bonus strategy that uses delays to get customers to pay you faster to get a better deal. This early bird strategy gets people to choose your higher value offers right now because the longer they wait, the more they miss out on. Now, even a single attraction mechanism can change your business overnight.
(36:17) Because when you chain, stack, and combine them, you get endless ways to make whatever you sell more attractive without changing what you sell. So, picture this. Tomorrow, without changing anything about what you sell, you wrap your current offer in an attraction mechanism. And suddenly, way more people come out of the woodwork asking to find out more who normally ignore what you have.
(36:35) And when done right, sometimes an attraction mechanism is just one tweak from feeding a business for life. So think about your current leads. Could you get more and make more money from them by nailing just one of these attraction offer mechanisms? So here's why I was forced to learn this. So the first time I started letting people know about my stuff, I did not have a flood of interest. If anything, people barely cared.
(36:53) It took me years to figure out how to transform something boring to exciting and turn strangers into buyers. That's what attraction offers do. But attraction accelerator came at a high cost. The cost of wasting millions and stupid mistakes enduring an endless stream of painful failures, making thousands of little tweaks that I had to figure out on my own.
(37:13) But above all else, it cost me a decade of my life that you'd have to go through trying to figure out how to perfect each of these mechanisms. Attraction accelerator helps you skip all of that. And so the bottom line is this. a correctly installed attraction offer so valuable you could literally ignore everything I show you and get more paying customers tomorrow.
(37:33) If you do this be the cheapest thing you ever invest in. And given that I charge $15,999 for licensing just one attraction mechanism to business owners. I think it's reasonable to value a track accelerator that includes not one but all five attraction mechanisms for $15,999. So that's the first thing you get.
(37:56) Now, if you're someone who doesn't get leads to buy enough at high enough prices, or they take multiple conversations to close, or they delay until they never do, then pay attention. This is for you. Turn every sale into an even bigger sale with epic upsells. So, here's why this matters. Attraction mechanisms get customers to make their first purchase. But if you want to maximize cash flow, you need to get them to buy more.
(38:20) So, what's the answer? Epic upsells. So, here's what they are. Upsells are whatever you offer next. Upsell mechanisms involve more better or newer versions of whatever they just bought. And they either solve a problem the earlier purchase reveals or they enhance value. So, here's why doing them right is important.
(38:38) When done wrong, people feel pressured, oversold, and taken advantage of. When done right, people love them and give you more money. Great. So, here's what you're going to get inside. Epic upsells give you my four mostused mechanisms to turn first-time buyers into bigger spenders. Upsell mechanism number one, classic upsells.
(38:57) A problem reveal method where customers sell themselves on your next offer without you needing to mention it. This upsell mechanism gets customers to realize they need your next thing right after they buy your first thing. Number two, menu upsells. I talked about this briefly earlier. A helpful consultant process that gets customers to realize you're not selling them stuff they don't need.
(39:15) Once you earn this trust, they'll take that next thing that you offer, usually buying way more expensive stuff faster and feeling grateful for it. This thing slays. You have to use it ethically. Number three, anchor upselles. A sticker shock strategy that get customers to happily spend way more than planned.
(39:34) After using it myself, I find customers are relieved to pay way more than they planned because your main thing looks like an incredible deal by comparison. And it is. Number four, rollover upsells. A pay it forward system that turns new customers into highest your highest paying repeat buyers and gets old customers more excited about your next offer.
(39:52) by getting customers to see a great deal right now. This upsell mechanism gets them to spend more money overall and faster. So, here's why I was forced to figure this out. So, early on, I got rejected a lot. Person after person told me they didn't want what I had. So, I got nervous asking for sales and then I'd freeze up.
(40:10) And I was right to be nervous because my approach sucked and I turned people off. And so, instead, I figured out mechanisms to make upsells not only natural, make it obvious the next offer is worth getting. And I want to save you the hundred of blown sales and millions in trial and error. They work without any real sales skills. You just present them. And so there's a right and a wrong way to do these.
(40:28) And I'll show you the best way. So I sold my supplement sales system for Prestige Labs, which included just one of these mechanisms for $6,000. It helped gyms generate over $23.6 million in verified earnings. That's not revenue. That was their earnings. And so Epic Upselles gives you all four, which is why I value it conservatively at $5,999.
(40:54) And given these mechanisms work for thousands of businesses, do you think you can get even one more person a month to take an upsell? So here's what you get. You get a traction accelerator valued at $15,999. You get epic upsells valued at $5,999. Total value $21,998. Now, I want to talk to somebody else in the audience.
(41:14) If you're someone who constantly hears no when you're selling, or you do payment plans and you get ghosted, or you push too hard and then sometimes you regret it, or you give out panic discounts to close the sale, or some just give up altogether when you hear no, this is for you. Turn every no into cash flow with dealmaker downells.
(41:31) So, here's why it matters. Attraction mechanisms are for getting the first purchase. Upsell mechanisms are designed to get the next one. But what if people say no? Answer: Dealmaker downells. Downell mechanism activate when customers say no.
(41:49) They're usually a change in payment structure, quality or quantity, or offer different conditions. Here's why doing them right is important. A proper down mechanism doesn't try to get customers to say yes to something they don't want. It's about getting them to say yes to something else they do. When done wrong, customers don't finish paying, they start haggling, or they don't buy and hate you. Here's what you get inside.
(42:07) Dealmaker downells give you my three simplest, most used, and highest converting mechanisms to turn a no into a yes. And the best part is you can use all three to boost cash flow without any sales skills. I use them in every business I own. And so here's how I use them.
(42:24) Anywhere someone can say no, you can and should install down mechasment and turn into a yes. Down mech is number one, payment plan downells. a cash flow algorithm that steps up, steps down customers from I can't afford it to when can I start without lowering your prices. I'll show you proven payment chunking that maximizes purchases and cash flow.
(42:44) Plus, I'll show you my seessaw technique that makes customers choose between huge cash savings now or tiny payments later. It's sick. Number two, trial downells. So, this is a skin in the game strategy that turns nos into yeses by letting customers prove to themselves that when they use your stuff as directed, it's worth paying for with a catch.
(43:04) The catch stops stops you from wasting money or time on free tire kickers. This down mechanism gets people to use your product right away, see real results, and then pay for it. This is awesome for beginners. Number three, feature downell. So, this is a custom fitting formula that turns no into yeses by giving customers exactly what they want at a price they can afford.
(43:22) And with my lock and key process, you just change qualities, quantities, or other product options to maximize what they pay for the value they get. So, I'll show you how to balance price versus value to get the most from every deal. I'll give you a hint. It's not a onetoone. So, here's why this exists.
(43:40) Dealmaker downells are cash flow maximizers you've always needed but didn't know existed. They're the real sales secrets you always look for but could never find. And you've probably heard of some or all of these, right? You might have even tried them. The magic isn't in the concept. It's in the details. It's in the execution.
(43:58) And I'll show you how I've sharpened these after years of testing and combining iterations from different businesses and industries from all over the world. So, this is also crazy to me because these mechanisms are huge for maximizing cash flow. Yet, no one teaches the right time to use them, how to price them, or how to structure them to turn nose into cash flow. That's the difference.
(44:16) Dealmaker downell measures work everywhere. Checkout pages, calls, presentations, or in person. If you sell to humans, they work. I know because I use them in all sales formats at all scales across physical products, services, and digital businesses. So, picture this. A prospect says, "I can't afford $6,000.
(44:36) " Instead of losing the sale, you say, "Okay, what if we did 250 a month for 24 months?" And you knew they'd pay. If they actually want your thing, then they'd say, "Yeah, nob brainer." And if every week you turn one no into cash flow, it makes a massive difference at the end of the year. Now turn the tables.
(44:53) Imagine someone offers you something for $6,000 and you really want it, but cash was tight this month. Then they say, "No worries. Why don't you do 24 payments of $249?" If you wanted it, that would probably make it a no-brainer. So, you do it. The key is knowing when to offer it and how to make sure you get paid. Given we spent $6.
(45:11) 5 million of research for a school to master just one of these. Number two, at 1/ 1,000th the cost, this is a steal at $6,499. And given these mechanisms, do you think you can get even one more person per month to take a downell? So, here's what you get. You get attraction accelerator valued at $15,999. You get epic upsells to get people to spend more, valued at $5,999. You get dealmaker downells to turn those nose into cash flow.
(45:39) Valued at $6,499. Total value $28,497. Now, this next one is is for those of you who are living sale to sale, week to week, on the cash flow roller coaster, and want to make consistent sales. I made this for you. Continuity blueprint, the holy grail of business. So, here's what it is. A continuity mechanism to get customers to keep making payments as long as you keep providing value.
(46:05) When done right, it stacks stable and predictable cash flow that grows automatically. When done wrong, it leads to rapid cancellations that burn your reputation and make you a sitting duck in hard times. To truly maximize your cash flow, you have to stop chasing sales and build a customer base that gets bigger every month. But there's a problem.
(46:23) No one wants another monthly bill. So, here's what you're going to get inside. I'll give you my three favorite continuity mechanisms designed to get people to want to opt into continuity and want to keep paying for continuity over time. So continuity mechanism number one, bonus continuity.
(46:39) So this is a gift wrapping strategy where you give customers something awesome but only if they sign up today. So this continuity mechanism dangles a bonus valuable enough to make customers first month feel better than free. This is how I stacked recurring revenue gym launch. And the way I do it, something I call the sliding scale, you can balance how much cash you collect upfront versus how much you push into subscriptions.
(46:56) And this is ideal for low cash flow industries. Number two, discount continuity. my free buttwin method that turns discounts into long-term commitments that boost cash flow. The mechanisms has five sub mechanisms depending on the type of thing you sell engineered to get customers to commit for an entire year upfront and stay while making them feel like they're getting a steal and they are. Number three, wave fee continuity.
(47:21) So, this is a penalty avoidance mechanism that incentivizes customers to avoid a big fee by committing long term. Get people to choose commitments over flexibility by making flexibility cost more. The best part, you get to pick the price of flexibility.
(47:40) This works particularly well in any business that takes time and resources to onboard new customers or get customers results. So, I built my fortune on continuity. Gyms, supplements, software subscriptions. Breaking even, getting recurring customers is the holy grail for making a company sellable and valuable. Continuity allowed us to sell all three brands in 2021. at a $46.2 million valuation.
(48:02) And every business wants recurring revenue, but customers don't want another subscription. These three mechanisms bridge that gap. So, learn from my mistakes. It took me 13 years of trial and error to get recurring revenue stacking month over month. The errors I made cost me millions in profits. Every day you keep making them cost you too. And the worst part with continuity, these costs compound.
(48:22) So, here's what it looks like when it's right. So, picture this. You advertise and instead of losing money getting people in the door and waiting months to recoup it, you break even or better. And each month you invest the extra cash flow of your recurring base into growth. Next month it's more. The month after that even more. That stacking is the power of continuity done right.
(48:42) For context, I sold a continuity system for gyms at 41 41,458 per year. And it only used one of these mechanisms. Inside the continuity blueprint, you'll get all three. So, it's reasonable value this at at least the same price of $41,458. So, here's what you get.
(49:06) You get attraction accelerator, which includes my five favorite most powerful attraction mechanisms, valued at $15,999. You get epic upsells with four of the most powerful upsell mechanisms that I know in existence to get people to spend more money, valued at $5,999. Then, if the person says no, don't worry. You've got three different trap doors that you can use that I use to turn nose into cash flow, which I value at $6,499.
(49:30) And then finally, if you want to have that growth every month and build that base is the continuity blueprint val,458, total value $69,955. result. You get more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again, resulting in each customer paying for themselves and the next customer, removing your limiter for growth, making your own $100 million money model.
(49:58) Once you learn how, you'll chain, stack, combine, layer, and sequence every money model mechanism like a monetization engineer. At the core, you do something simple. You find every problem customers have and offer to solve them at the right time, the right place, the right way.
(50:15) Do this and you become a master of monetization. You can instantly make any product more compelling to more people and change nothing about what you deliver, just how they buy and how much they spend when they do. Correctly. Installing even one of these can literally change your life. You don't need to do anything else. Because if business feels hard, you may think the same thing that I did, that you need to change industries or switch businesses.
(50:39) But you really just need to change your money model. Listen, these systems are more valuable than the masterminds that sell for $25,000, $50,000, even $100,000 from gurus who've never even done it and will give you hilariously more value than a four-year degree. But to put this in perspective, if you paid my hourly rate for 101 money strategy, it would cost you a million dollar a day. And that's not marketer math. That's what I get paid right now.
(51:03) So, if I priced this at what it's worth, 69,955, it would be beyond reasonable for the entire system. And before I tell you the price, let me ask you a question. How much is double your lead flow worth to you? How much is double your cash flow worth to you? How much is double your growth worth to you? Actually, think about it.
(51:29) Like how much is that actually worth to you? Hold that number in your head. If you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it would happen, which of course you can't because all business involves risk. My results aren't typical and your results will vary. But if you did, wouldn't it be worth at least that much? Because after 100 mill offers, when 100 mill leads came out, I got zillions of messages of people's lives and businesses being changed.
(51:58) And for all those guys, it would have been worth it at any price. And that's why the $100 money model system is a bargain at not $69,955, but $29,997. And consider this. If all this did was allow you to start your first business like it did for me, or scale your businesses without followers or cash, or break through your multi-year plateau finally, or save your business from closing like it did for me during co.
(52:25) If all this did was in 24 months give you the skills to launch an event like this, even a hundredth the size, using only what's inside, wouldn't it be worth it? I think so, too. Which is why it's an even bigger bargain at not 2 and $9,997, but $9,997. Because if every week all it does is get you one more customer at twice the value, at twice the speed, it'd be more than worth it. And the best part is you only invest once.
(52:57) You can monetize these skills for the rest of your life. Which is why skills are always the best investment. Look, if I put my last $1,000 in the S&P 500 in 2016, which returns 9% a year, I'd have $2,400 today. But instead, I invested my last $1,000 in the S&P 500 skills and turn that $1,000 into the business we have now.
(53:24) So, which would you rather have? 9,997 were the business you want, right? Me, too. Which is why this may be the best offer I've ever given at not $9,997, but $5,997. And because I want each of you to 2x, 5x, 10x your growth and business over the next 12 months. And to be clear, I want that for you, but no way guarantee it because most people do nothing. So, results will vary.
(53:50) But I know how life-changing this system has been for my family. And I want this to be affordable for everyone, but still an investment. I'm not going to ask for $69,955, even though it'd be totally reasonable and a bargain. I'm not going to ask for $29,997. I'm not going to ask for 9,997. I'm not even going to ask for 5,997.
(54:14) And given each book demonstrates the concept inside, it only makes sense that money models be about making money, that I charge something for the system. And I feel a duty to demonstrate how to make offers properly so people don't feel bad about making exceptional products available for purchase.
(54:33) Which is why I'm going to give you access to everything I talked about today. the attraction accelerator, epic upsells, dealmaker downells, continuity blueprint that will show you how to harness all 15 money model mechanisms in your business for three payments of three interestf free payments of $0. Yes, it's 100% free. It's all yours.
(55:13) It's my way of saying thank you for being a part of this movement. I almost forgot. On top of that, you'll also get the Money Models audio book 100% free. So, you get both the Money Model system and the Money Models audiobook all free. And for those you are here for my promise at the beginning to get something that's better than an NFT and less than a Bitcoin, I've got something else for you here live.
(55:41) Did I say that I wrote just one book since last time? Well, I didn't. I wrote another book in secret. And so it's with great pride that I'd like to present to you the lost chapters. This thing is beautiful. This tome contains 24 chapters that I couldn't fit in offers, leads, or money models. It includes complex like this and this and this and a zillion more.
(56:23) And this will be for sale for $29.99 after this event. But for everyone here, you can get a free digital copy just for being here live now. So you get the money model system, you get the money models audio book, and the lost chapters all free. That's enough value, right? Yeah. Or is there even more? Because to not just read this stuff, but to actually use it, you're going to need the tools.
(57:03) So, to make sure everyone who wants to start a business can use money models, one of my investment stipulations for school was that when the time was right, we could do three things. Number one, add everything needed to make money models work into the platform itself, which with the features launching this month, we did. So that's number one.
(57:22) Number two, I wanted to give you enough free time to get going. So instead of 14 days free, you with me here today get not 14 days free, not 30 days free, not 45 days free, not even 60 days free, but 90 days free. And number three, since inception, school's price has been $99 a month. It hasn't changed. But since you're here with me live today, for anyone who stays after the 90 days free, that gives you the time to get going to use this stuff.
(58:06) We drove down the price from $99 a month to only $9 a month for life, but it's only for this book launch. So, I'm proud to say, and maybe you'll agree with me, that we accomplished all three. We install, you can install the full money model segment into the platform. You have seven times the free time to actually get going. You know, 11 times cheaper price afterwards.
(58:33) So, if you're an upandcoming entrepreneur, this is your free tech starter kit. This is the best head start I can give you. I get it. I was broke. This is the head start I can give you. So, you get the money model system, the money models audiobook, the lost chapters and school, all free and a lifetime lower rate after 90 days for nine bucks.
(58:59) And so, all those will be available Tuesday morning after the launch. So, now at the beginning, I said I was going to help two types of people today. up andcoming entrepreneurs. I promised you I would help you get closer to that two-day for free period. And I just delivered the money model system free, the money models audiobook free, the lost chapters free, 90 days of school free, and then 11 times lower price after that.
(59:35) Do you feel like I kept my promise? Hey guys, would you um would you mind taking the slides down for a second? So when I started this like thinking of this idea for this book and how I was going to present it to the world, the first thing that I wrote down was kind of just something that I wanted to say and I tried to weave it into the presentation and I I couldn't I couldn't get it to to work the way I wanted to and so I figured maybe I would just read it to you. So hope you guys are are cool with that.
(1:00:06) So, I could only make this promise because I have a business and I live in a country that allows me to do business. So, I could give this stuff away that costs me money for free. And I want to tell you why now. So, there's a mission I have here today.
(1:00:24) I want to show the world that one of us can start from nothing and achieve anything we put our hearts and minds to. So, what do I mean by one of us? I mean the small business, the entrepreneur, entrepreneurs like you, like me, like all of us here together in this moment. We're the ones who together provide the jobs, create and innovate, and fuel the economy, no matter what country we're in.
(1:00:45) But we also take the most risk. We pay the most taxes. We work the longest hours. We miss more baseball games and dance recital than any other group in the world. And all over the world, there are entrepreneurs, one of us, who are overworked. They're stressed out. They're worried about making payroll, about paying rent.
(1:01:02) And it shouldn't be like that because you, the entrepreneur, you're the ones who along with your fellow entrepreneurs who sit with you here today, you're the ones who make the world go round. And not a single one of us should have to experience that stress, that overwhelm, that struggle. Which is why I need your help.
(1:01:21) So sure, let's scale together, but let's do something more. To quote J.R. Tolken in the Two Towers, there's some good in this world. It's worth fighting for. As you know, our mission has always been to make real business education accessible to everyone. But there's a deeper reason behind that mission and I want to share it with you now.
(1:01:37) I think that if we can help our fellow entrepreneurs grow their business by even a tiny fraction of percent each, the net effect could literally change the world. And that is the impact I want us to have together. As usual, I don't have a course to sell you. I just gave you all that stuff and more away for free.
(1:01:55) But I am so committed to helping our people change the world for the better that I do have an amazing gift I'd like to give you. when you help me with this. So, we can all agree that the stuff in this book works. Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here today. And if we accept that to be true, then we can also agree that the more businesses there are that have this book, the more we can help, the more we, this community of entrepreneurs, the very backbone of the world, the more we can work together to get this book into the hands of the people who need it, the more good we'll be doing for everyone. Which is why I'd like to invite you to do something big. So before I tell you
(1:02:26) what it is to the beginners who just got all that free stuff, are you going to complain if I incentivize the business people to donate a ton of books? Great. Can you guys bring the slides back up? Hundred million dollar men, please bring out my my table. Let's do this. All right. Well, then let's rock and roll. Oh, I need my clicker. There we go. Thank you.
(1:03:02) Are these guys great? Now, business owners, players, money makers, if you're in the game, I made this for you. I said I'd show you how it's in your best interest to help me help everyone else and how we can accomplish both our goals together. So, I'm going to ask you to donate 200 books. That's $5,998 in book donations.
(1:03:33) Then, I'm going to spend the next few minutes explaining why donating 200 books will be the best business decision that you make this year easily. Because two years ago, I'd already written the Money Models book. This is a picture of me at the last launch with the book when I showed it at the end. I'd already recorded the money model's audio.
(1:03:51) I'd already assembled the money model system, the whole thing. And then I asked myself, if I wanted business owners to help me get these books in the hands of every entrepreneur in America, that's 32 and a half million people, what would be the most valuable thing I could do to incentivize business owners to have them help me make it happen? My answer, working one-on-one with you to implement everything I know into your specific business today.
(1:04:15) So, I did something crazy, or at least a little unorthodox. Only weeks after my last book launch, I started inviting business owners out to my headquarters for small private in-person workshops. And hearing that, you might be thinking, for a guy with an international 13 million plus person audience, offering small private in-person workshops using his actual portfolio team might be the dumbest, least scalable model imaginable. And you'd be right if you didn't know why I did it.
(1:04:46) You see, I started these workshops weeks after the last launch to prepare for this one. And over the last 18 months, we met in person with over 1,026 plus small businesses across all these industries. A lot. And across all these different revenue brackets, also a lot.
(1:05:03) And I didn't do all these meetings, all these workshops, all these consultations because I thought they were scalable. They're not. I did it all for this moment to get one thing. Data. I wanted to know once and for all the problems you're dealing with right now. What's limiting your growth today? Your bottlenecks at this moment. Everything that's keeping you up at night.
(1:05:21) Everything is holding you back. Everything that's keeping you stuck. And after meeting with 1,26 plus businesses in person, we codified everything. And every business's growth was constrained by one of four things. Leads, you can't get enough qualified prospects. sales, you can't convert the prospects you got into customers.
(1:05:41) Delivery, you can't retain the customers you got long enough or you do in the first three, but your bank account doesn't show it. So, we developed complete systems to fully solve every constraint. Four systems in total. The leads constraint, we solve the lead system, the sales constraint, created the sales system, the delivery constraint, created the delivery system, and the profit constraint, created the profit system. No small task.
(1:06:00) But here's what makes these systems different from everything else out there. These aren't theories. They're tested solutions. Each developed by working with 1,26 plus real businesses directly. Every system contains the exact processes, scripts, and literal checklists we give our $35,000 plus advisory clients to break through their biggest constraints. And these aren't digital downloads or PDFs, and they never will be.
(1:06:25) They're just too valuable. And there's not some login that you'll never use or some file that you'll scroll through and then forget. This had to be a physical implementation system. You're getting something that you can hold, reference, and display on your shelf and implement from something with hard cost and real value.
(1:07:01) All bound together, organized by system, in one premium binder. Each system contains its own set of playbooks. So, let me show you what's inside. Don't worry, I'll get make it nice and pretty for you. Here we go. Here we go. Boom. All right. So for the lead system, there's four playbooks. One, two, three, four.
(1:07:39) For the sales system, there's three playbooks. For the delivery system, there's two playbooks. And for the profit system, there's three playbooks. to solve all codified constraints. And given 1,26 plus business owners just paid $35,000 for just part of one playbook, just part of one of these just part of one that unlocks their specific business constraint.
(1:08:21) All 12 is $420,000 of real and true have charged for it value. And today, right now, I want to put all 12 in your hands when you help me put 200 books in the hands of the entrepreneurs who need them. That's $5,998 in book donations. And you're going to want to get them right now at go.acq.com. Now, I've got good news and I've got bad news.
(1:08:55) The good news is I secured a partnership through a firm to make it affordable to anyone who wants to donate. So even more of you who want to get the playbooks can. And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate books to get everything in your hands for as little as $249 a month interest free. And if you aren't seeing a firm, you can hit the little three dots on the top and then check out as guest. It's also on the bottom.
(1:09:19) That's if you're already logged into shop Shopify. Anyways, at 249 a month, it comes out to donating two books a week. That's it. And I made donating super easy by hiring and training 300 plus phone reps to help anyone out who has issues checking out. You'll see their number on any field checkout. Just call and they'll help you.
(1:09:38) But on top of that, when you support the other entrepreneurs by donating books, you won't have to wait until Tuesday for the free stuff. You'll get access to everything now. Now for the bad news. I only assembled 25,000 of these implementation systems. It's likely we'll sell 25,000 of these implementation systems.
(1:09:59) Just to put this in perspective, there are 113,000 of you here live. I also plan on emailing my 1.4 million person list with this offer. We also have 21,990 affiliates. And to be clear, that's not 21,9990 people. That's 21,9990 audiences. a mountain of people, which is already way more than the number of systems I assembled. And with three million plus people, we need less than 1% of businesses to donate.
(1:10:24) But historically, less than 1% is fairly low for a live book launch like this. For context, about 2% is a normal lead conversion rate for a live launch. My last launch, for example, we converted 56,56 out of 463,000. So 12.2 2%. Significantly higher. Now, this is a different offer, but also way more people.
(1:10:50) So, it's reasonable that we'll be at what I think between 3 and 5%. Which would move all 25,000 quickly. Now, if you're wondering why I did this, it's for two reasons. One, scarcity changes behavior, and I wanted to give the business owners who cared the most a good reason to act the fastest in the best ways I know how.
(1:11:10) And two, I just didn't order enough. So, if you want to guarantee yours, grab them now because it's mathematically probable that we will sell the 25,000. And the donation deal will only get better, as you'll soon see. And for the altered business owners who always ask, "Do you have anything more if we donate even more?" For the first time ever, the answer is yes, and you will like it.
(1:11:35) It's the number one request I've had from business owners for four years. It's a one-time thing I'm only doing for this launch. It includes access to me for six months along with some serious goodies you'd only appreciate as a serious business owner. If you donate even more books, but you got to grab the 200 books to see that, you'll see that ultra business owner bonus on the 200 purchase confirmation page. Anyways, quick logistics.
(1:12:00) The 200 books you donate get sent to entrepreneurs who need them. You don't have to worry about physically storing or shipping the donated books. That was the number one request from last year. If you want any copies for yourself, you'll get a code to get as many as you want, up to 199. just pay shipping and handling whenever you redeem it.
(1:12:13) The code is good for a year. Any books that you don't use or give away, we will. And yes, this entire donation is a 100% dollar fordoll tax deduction for businesses. And to use a firm, remember, just check out as guest. Now, for all my international folks, I'm very proud to say the team works so hard to do this. We're live in 50 countries, which is absolutely absurd. Last year, I think we had eight. All right.
(1:12:36) International shipping, by the way, super expensive because books are heavy and because physics is real and to fly a book over an ocean, it costs money. So, blame your governments for taxes and physics for existing. All right, that being said, I put on the screen quickly what uh what countries we're going to right now.
(1:12:54) Basically, I had the option of expensive shipping or not shipping there at all. So, we went with that. So, while you guys check out, here's what you're getting. You're donating 200 bucks. You're getting 200 bucks of real value. And the first system that you're going to get is the leads implementation system. These playbooks give you the tools to unlock unlimited leads for yourself.
(1:13:16) Like how to scale ads with the goated ads playbook. How to write hooks that sell not just get views with the hooks playbook. How to build a reputation that gets the right people to buy with the branding playbook. And build the operational flows to remove yourself from marketing entirely with the marketing machine playbook. So let's take a look inside.
(1:13:34) So there we go. The first is the goated ads playbook. So if you ever hit a ceiling on your ad spend, your CPAs go crazy, CAT goes really high, can't scale past a certain point. This playbook gives you the exact process we follow to break through ad spend ceilings and keep scaling. So here's just a fraction of what's inside.
(1:13:57) The ad assembly process which shows how to turn 500 ads 55 five ads into 600 ads per month using hook meet CTA. Our ad scaling strategy which shows you how to target every customer segment from completely aware to most aware. This is how you actually scale creative and hooks to break into new markets and new customer segments.
(1:14:15) And the 702010 framework so you can juice winning campaigns way longer and duplicate them more easily. So that's the first playbook that you get inside of the leads implementation system. The second is the Hooks playbook. If you create any content, ads, social media, emails, anything, this contains the 8020 of hookw writing from 35,000 plus pieces of content. Like, I didn't wake up with a with a viral video, right? And have people just appear. I had to will this.
(1:14:39) I had to force this. I had to do a lot of volume. And so, here's a fraction of what's inside of what I'll show you. Proven formulas that work across every content type. Best performing hooks across all platforms, email, social, ads, everything. simple checklist to create winning hooks every time.
(1:14:56) And so that's the second playbook that you get inside of the leads implementation system. The third playbook you get is the brand playbook. And some of you guys may have noticed that direct response isn't working like it used to. This shows you how to build a premium brand that commands way higher prices and gets cheaper leads who buy more often.
(1:15:15) Cracking this enabled me to break through my $30 million plus revenue ceiling that I was stuck at for over three years. So, here's just a preview of what's inside. The exact topics and associations to pick and build the brand that gets you the customers and sales you want. The brand flywheel, how to reinforce, broaden, narrow, scale, or pivot a brand.
(1:15:33) The perfect positioning process to turn views into sales instead of just vanity metrics. So, that's the third playbook that you're going to get inside of the leads implementation system. The fourth is the marketing machine. So, let's face it, making ads and content can be tiring.
(1:15:51) This is how you remove yourself as the face of your marketing. It took me 18 months to remove my face completely from Gym Launch while growing sales. So, here's just a fraction of what's inside. Nine perpetual ad flows that generate fresh marketing content weekly. These are so sexy.
(1:16:08) A one-time setup that captures testimonials and ads from everything you already do. And the complete system to exit your phase from marketing without losing sales. Without this, I would have never been able to sell Gym Launch. So, if I were you, I'd be like, "Well, is there any proof?" Ah, glad you asked. Here's some proof this works.
(1:16:28) This is what we spent advertising this event to get you here. Up to 500,000 a day. You can't reach this scale without systems that scale with you. That was just August 13th. 28,000 229,000. All right. And the result was 584,000 registrations and selling more books before this launch than we sold at the last launch.
(1:16:52) And using these playbooks and checklists, I grew from zero to 13 plus million person audience across all platforms in 5 years. This is how you can will your brand and not luck it into existence. And using the tactics contained in the marketing machine, this puppy is how we created,452 ads for this launch. for just our first round of ads. We actually got a warning from Facebook because we neared our ad limit.
(1:17:16) I don't know if you've ever gotten that before, but if you have a system that can scale, that's what scale looks like. And these don't just work for me. This is Chris How. He's a commercial architect. He was able to scale his deal pipeline from a few deals a month to tripling his business's growth. And using these principles, Jorge was able to scale his ads and lead flow for his local pharmacy. He said, "After launching the strategy your team gave us, business exploded, traffic surged by over 30%.
(1:17:35) We had to grow the team just to keep up the first month. And Ava, who's 19 years old, was able to take her content agency from 10 to 15 new deals a month to 40 to to 60 new deals a month. And these were B2B high ticket recurring sales. So that's your leads implementation system.
(1:17:53) Four playbooks that solve the biggest leads constraints we found in 1,26 plus businesses. So when you donate the 200 bucks, you're going to get all four playbooks. the GoDads playbook, the Hooks playbook, the branding playbook, the marketing machine playbook. All free if you just go to go.acq.com. Now, there's more. The second system you get is the sales implementation system.
(1:18:18) Whether you can't get leads to show, can't close them when they do, or it's taking forever to get a yes, these playbooks show what we've done to solve these problems for good. So, the first is the lead nurture playbook. At Allen, we analyzed every variable that increases shows across a 100,000 appointments.
(1:18:35) The findings in this playbook contain the most datadriven show system that I'm aware of. So, here's just a fraction of what you'll get. The four pillars of lead nurture, tactics to maximize speed, volume, personalization, and medium to get more schedules. The 16 actions we take to turn schedules into shows, and achieve an 89% show rate that takes zero skill.
(1:18:53) You just follow the checklist. And what's crazy is that most entrepreneurs waste time just obsessing over close rates. And there's nothing wrong with obsessing over close rates, but if you just follow a process, you can increase sales way more than any train team training or new skills by just checking the list.
(1:19:12) So that's the first playbook you can get in the sales implementation system. The second is the closing playbook. So when I was living in motel at $100,000 in debt, my sales team couldn't close. I actually had to fly out. This playbook contains the exact closes. I drilled them on to save my business. So, here's a preview of what's inside.
(1:19:31) The seven universal closes. They work no matter what a prospect says. They're the first seven every salesman must memorize. And I've never seen these identified and I've never included them in my content because I was saving it for this. The reframe framework turns every question into a buying statement and gets avoiders to decide while real nos reveal their true concerns.
(1:19:56) and the urgency creation system, the words to say to make prospects buy now instead of thinking about it even when you have no deadline. So that's the second playbook that you get inside of the sales implementation system. The third is the proof playbook. Sales take too long because you don't have enough of the right kind of proof at the right times. This playbook solves that.
(1:20:16) So here's just a fraction of its contents. The belief continuum. How to move prospects from consideration to buying. The beliefs the system that I use to capture volume of proof so testimonials happen automatically and overwhelm competitors. So think proof over promise. It works in person and online. And the 13point proof checklist that instantly diagnoses why your emails, ads, and calls aren't converting.
(1:20:41) So here's some proof this actually works. Here are my actual show rates for ACQ for this year using the lead nurture playbook. Those are actual show rates. These are our close rates from this year. And I used over 213 examples of proof during this presentation following this 13point proof checklist.
(1:21:06) And to prove this works for any business, not just ours, we actually used all three playbooks when working with a portfolio company IBC Global, which is insurance. So here's a direct quote from the founder, Steve. We went from 20% to 61% conversion of all appointments. 3xed our total appointments converted using the ACQ nurture closing and proof process.
(1:21:25) Numbers are up and to the right big time. Think about what a different 20 to 61. And this is not a small business. And here's another portfolio company we use all three playbooks in. So this year, well operations took their close rates from 27% to 45%. A massive difference for the business. just following the process. So that's your sales implementation system.
(1:21:50) Three playbooks to solve the biggest sales related constraints we found in 126 plus businesses. So here's what you're getting. You're getting 200 books right off the bat, right? Which you're donating. You're getting the lead system, which includes the goated ads playbook, which will show you how to break through the limitations for your ad scaling, which is one of the biggest issues that people can't scale on the front end. You're getting the hooks playbook. You're getting the branding playbook. You're getting the marketing machine playbook. All free.
(1:22:12) Then you're getting the sales system. You have lead nurture playbook to turn uh clicks into schedules and schedules into shows. At the end of the day, you can't sell people if they don't show up. Then you've got closing so once they do show up, you can get them to buy. And we've got the proof checklist to make the whole thing happen faster. All three of those free.
(1:22:31) We're not done. So, next up, you get Let's see if I put this without making it all fall over. And we stuck the landing. Did we stick the landing? There we go. All right. So, the next is the delivery implementation system. This solves the two biggest constraints that kill profitability. Customers not paying enough and customers not staying long enough.
(1:22:59) The first is the lifetime value playbook. So, if leads cost too much, it's common that they don't really cost too much, but that you make too little. The customer value multiplication framework helps solve this. So, here's just a fraction of what's inside. The eight ways customers can transact with your business.
(1:23:16) Leverage all eight and never worry about rising CAC. Again, most businesses only use one or two. That's what's crazy. Nine real like actually work cost cutting frameworks that drop every save dollar straight to your bottom line. And the customer value map, which shows how to maximize revenue per customer interaction ethically.
(1:23:38) So, that's the first of the two delivery playbooks that you're going to get. The second is the retention playbook. So, I've been in the recurring revenue business my entire life. Understanding churn has been a scientific process for me. Like show rates, it's not one thing. It's a hundred small things and you got to do them all. The good news, the hard part is figuring out what they are.
(1:23:55) The easy part is actually doing them. So, here's a preview of what's inside. Real retention data from millions of memberships showing how to reverse engineer churn from engagement activation. Remember McConer of school. I see a lot of revenue that's recurring. I see a lot of memberships and I have the data because it's all in one platform.
(1:24:13) The five the updated five horseman retention for service-based businesses and the complete ninestep churn elimination protocol with activation points and onboarding frameworks. So that's the second playbook you're going to get. But here's proof this works. So we use these and we widen a portfolio company of ours. They whiten teeth if you didn't get that.
(1:24:38) and 2xed how much customers were worth and how fast they paid with the extra cash dropping straight to the bottom line. Want to guess how big of an impact it made? Which 7 and 12xed profit per location. That's not a typo. Imagine that for a second. 7 and a halfxed per location across all 17 stores in two years without changing anything about their core services. They still whiten teeth and only changing the money model.
(1:25:11) And to give you another example, here's our month 12 retention on school. This retention curve is how we have 15 plus million users on school which means that we retain so well that we net more than one user per user which makes school school grow even faster. So here's proof this works not just for my business but any business.
(1:25:31) So this is what Eric and Amanda E who own a digital art marketplace said. AOV more than doubled. Result better customers who pay faster pay more. Thank us for it. We maintain revenue improve margins and we can breathe. Here's another. This is Paul Law, founder of Multiverse Beans had to say. I attribute a lot of the growth. That's what you said to me at the workshop.
(1:25:49) Customer journey is what matters most. Overall, 66% growth for 7 and a half months. So that's your delivery implementation system. Two playbooks that solve the biggest delivery related constraints we found in 126 plus businesses. So here's what you're getting when you donate 200 books. You're getting the lead system which includes goed ads, hooks, branding, and marketing.
(1:26:12) And if you just use the hooks alone, like if you think about the front end of a business, the hook is how every single person actually starts going from cold to warm. If you were just able to increase the amount of people that just take that first step, everything else downfunnel increases just from that one thing. And this is just one of the four playbooks that you get inside of lead system for free.
(1:26:30) On top of that, inside of the sales system, you have lead nurture, closing, and proof. If people are taking way too long to buy, it's because you don't have the right kind and enough at the right times of proof. and the checklist show you how to do that. You'll get all three of those playbooks for free. On top of that, you'll get the delivery system which shows you how to juice the hell out of LTV and retain customers once they start paying. Free.
(1:26:50) Next up, you get But wait, there's more. The profit implementation system. This is the last constraint that kills businesses. You work all day every day for the small percentage of cash left over at the end of the month. With a few tweaks, that number could be much bigger.
(1:27:10) These playbook contains the three lowest operational effort systems you can implement into a business to prove its cash position. So the first is the fast cash playbook. How to inject cash into a business using only what you've already got. Every business needs a way to generate cash quickly.
(1:27:28) Taxes, emergencies, extra payroll months, funding and expansion, or my personal favorite, just to give yourself a raise. So here's just a fraction of what's inside. Ready to send seven-day countdown, email, text, promotion sequences tested on thousands of businesses. A quarterly cash calendar system with 90-day rotation so you can just set these and run them on a cadence.
(1:27:45) The fast cash checklist to help you pick and assemble your list, pick your offer, price it, and send it. This thing is awesome. So, that's the first playbook that you get inside of the profit implementation system. The second is the pricing playbook. This contains my top 10 mostused instant pricing based profit optimizations.
(1:28:02) These are the first strategies that I would use to cover this donation. If I zapped into your position right now and I was just jumping into the business, this is the first thing I would use. So, here's a preview of what's inside. 10 instant pricing optimizations. Uh, for example, going monthly to 28 day cycles, that's an 8.3% increase in billing.
(1:28:22) That's just one of 10 different optimizations that are in here. And that's bullet one. The next is 17 pricing algorithms. They explain if this, then that. If at full capacity and need to do need help, do X. If at full capacity and don't, do Y. And just to put this in in perspective, if you were to implement all of these, assuming you had none and you didn't change sales, it would represent a gigantic increase in profit.
(1:28:46) And I have yet to meet a business that has every one of these installed. The third is the price raise playbook. This is the last of the three profit implementation playbooks. If you raise prices, you make more doing the same or less work. This is the highest leverage thing you can send tomorrow. So, here's just a fraction of what you'll get inside. How to find your pricing sweet spot without losing customers or needing fancy analytics.
(1:29:10) The price raise method with trap doors to keep select customers without playing favorites. And the price raise letter tested by hundreds of businesses. Fill in the blanks and send. This thing is gold. It's amazing. I have tested this with so many different types of businesses. Like, this is awesome.
(1:29:30) So, here's proof this works. Part of how Gym Launch sold $16,000 packages in a market with a $32,000 median income was fast cash plays. We gave them the skills to make the money to afford the help they needed. And the result of these pricing levers, when used together, were Gym Launch's actual gross margins.
(1:29:52) And so, here's proof this works. Not just for my business, but any business. So, here's Corey. He owns uh ProShot HVAC duck cleaners. This is what he said. These principles were super easy to implement in my business. Almost like finding $100 bills everywhere I went. After sitting down with my business, I'm fairly confident to say this brought 15 to 20% back in my business that was just sitting there.
(1:30:10) Think about your business. If you dropped 15 to 20% mortgage bottom line, would that be a big deal? Probably. Just from doing things that were already there, just repositioning. And here's what Tuzain said, who owns a marketing agency that sells to stem cell clinics. The pricing playbook alone, this guy, paid for my VAM workshop.
(1:30:35) Before using it, I had a lot of friction increasing LTV for my clients due to selling a high ticket offer. I read the book on my flight home, implemented Alex's taxes, and not only did we triple LTV, we also tripled the amount of clients who were signing up all due to the positioning tactics in the playbook. Now, I don't know about you, tripling LTV, tripling the amount of customer you sign up. Good.
(1:30:55) And so, here's more proof the pricing playbook works for any business. So, James Patrick, he's a health consultant. If you guys are looking for feedback on $100 pricing, this this stuff is gold. An easy read on our flight. Jeff cler How to make XYZ. Frank LaRosa, Elite Recruiting.
(1:31:13) You can tell Alex's pricing playbook is one of the best books ever um I've ever read in terms of having immediate impact when I roll these out. Roof leopard. Uh, we get nosed due to our pricing and are closing at 42% close rate this season while increasing our average ticket from last year by $5,500. That's per sale increased by $5,500. Not bad. Now, these are businesses that used the price raise playbook.
(1:31:35) This puppy, so Danielle Thompson, we took our price from $115 uh per month to $1.96 every four weeks. We were super scared to send the letter, but it ended up being the single best decision we made as a business. And here's Stephen. I rolled out this price increase letter to 32 clients. Honestly, I wasn't sure it would land. Raising me memberships by $226 a month.
(1:31:54) Added 226, right? It ended up being the single fastest revenue I've ever pulled in business ever. Stephanie took my price from 200 to 396 to and 516 a month. It was the best decision we have made for our business and we have not looked back since. and Leander implemented a 78% membership uh price hike across 700 subscriptions.
(1:32:15) It was a bold move, but allowed me to significantly boost revenue, reinvest the member experience, and elevate the perceived value of the brand. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions we made for long-term growth. So, that's your profit implementation system. Three playbooks to solve the biggest profit related constraints we found in 126 plus businesses. So, here's what you get in the $100 million money models implementation system.
(1:32:37) Doesn't that look nice? There we go. Oops. Oh, that could have been bad. There we go. Okay, so here's what you're getting when you donate 200 bucks to entrepreneurs and need them. You're getting the entire lead system, all four playbooks, goated ads, hooks, branding, and the marketing machine so you can remove your face from making content or ads if you so desire free.
(1:33:04) You're getting the sales system which includes lead nurture closing and proof so you can accelerate your sales, accelerate your cash flow cycle over and over by just installing these checklists free. You're also getting the delivery system which includes increasing LTV and retaining customers longer through one of the one of which the turn elimination elimination elimination protocol free and the profit system which includes fast cash pricing and the price raise letter that you can immediately send. This the lowest operational drag thing.
(1:33:26) If I were to jump into your business tomorrow, I would start with the profit implementation playbook and boom. All solving the real constraints of 1,26 plus real businesses like yours. So this isn't theory. These are the solutions we charge $35,000 for to be clear, plus obviously one day of inerson delivery.
(1:33:44) So think of these as your treasure map for scaling from where you are to where you want to go. And today you get all 12 playbooks free when you donate 200 books to entrepreneurs who need them. There we go. So if you want all 12 implementation playbooks, go to go.acq.com right now.
(1:34:08) And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate the books and get everything in your hands for as little as 249. Again, interest free if you qualify. And if you're not seeing it, just make sure you check out as a guest. All right, there's one at the top and the bottom you can click. And if you have trouble checking out, we have 300 phone reps who are there to help you get support. All right.
(1:34:26) And uh while you're checking out, let me show you how we're going to make sure you implement the right solution at the right time for you. So imagine you're about to begin on this quest. But what happens when you hit a roadblock specific to your exact business situation? Most people get stuck and give up. I couldn't personally consult with everyone, but I had an idea that changed everything.
(1:34:45) So, I told you that we met with 1,026 plus businesses who paid over $35,000 each. That's $35 million in advisory work. But one thing I left out is I also personally met with 226 plus businesses that paid $135,000 or more each for me to one-on-one break down their business. Now, look at this behemoth. I compiled all my notes on each of the 226 businesses that I worked with one-on-one.
(1:35:23) If I spaced out working with all those businesses with no weekends, it would be one business every other day, end to end for two years. And look, I took pictures of all of them. A truly backbreaking amount of work. And I definitely didn't do it because one-on-one consulting in person scales, but because the biggest issue I continue to have is people asking, "Hey, Alex, what should I do to grow my business?" And I really desperately want to answer that question for you. But there's only so many hours in the day, and I still have my main job at ACQ. So, I
(1:35:53) personally documented the exact problems and solutions for 226 plus businesses. I did this monstrous amount of work that can't scale for a very particular reason to to build something that can. So, here's what I did. For every business I met with, we had intake calls. We took down their stats, their industry. We did a uh I took a sensive notes. We did a constraint analysis.
(1:36:19) I personally delivered the recommendations in person. I documented their exact problems and solutions, exactly what they would need to act on and in what order, and organized follow-up to give them their next steps. Now, to all my folks who paid $135,000, don't worry. Your data is protected, your data is safe.
(1:36:41) But again, I personally consulted every business, recorded every intake call, every constraint analysis, every recommendation, every follow-up call, all my actual notes. I recorded all of it. All in preparation for this very moment. Violent, obscene, ruthless, wise. ACQAI customtrained on everything. So I trained a custom AI on everything.
(1:37:19) my ended analysis of each of the 226 plus businesses, every constraint, every solution, every implementation step, plus all three books, offers, leads, and money models. Then I trained it on all the implementation playbooks that you just got, the leads implementation playbooks, the sales implementation playbooks, the profit implementation playbooks, the delivery implementation playbooks, and I plugged it into this AI so we have consistent inputs and outputs. Now, I worked with a lot of businesses over the last two years.
(1:37:43) Here's just a few of them. We had pest control, carpet cleaning, restaurants, waste management, logistics, cannabis, lighting, legal, accounting, wealth, tax, financial adviserss, marketing agencies, content creators, influencers, media companies, roofing, construction, remodelers, real estate brokerages, lenders, real estate agents, real estate investors, fund managers, crypto funds, web design, IT services, content ads, branding agencies, design shops, online coaches, gyms, nail salon, hair salon, massage therapy, med spas, auto repair, coaching
(1:38:06) courses, community owners, online businesses, e-commerce, car dealerships, logging, franchisers, meal prep, e-commerce brands, virtual assistant agencies, recruiters, insurance, physical therapy, B2B SAS, B2B services, B TOC SAS, B TOC services, cash practice, general practitioners, dentists, surgeons, urgent carees, pharmacies, HVAC, plumbing, lawn care, and residential and commercial cleaning.
(1:38:26) So, if you're wondering, but will it be able to help with my specific business? Yes, for three reasons. First, that was 60 of them. I did more than four times that. Second, because I probably helped a business exactly like yours, not once, but multiple times. Some bigger, some smaller, some exactly the same size.
(1:38:52) And third, even if I hadn't found or worked with one exactly like yours, you should want insights from outside your industry. That's how you get ahead. Result, you get answers in minutes that would take you years of trial and error to discover on your own. And the best part, you'll never have to wonder what would ALC do in my specific situation again.
(1:39:14) And so if the playbooks are your map, then ACQAI is your vehicle to getting there. This is the first time this data has ever been made available to anyone. And at no small cost. And if this sounds absurdly valuable, it's because it is. Normally, a fraction of this intelligence would cost $135,000 per consultation. It's literally the most valuable thing I can give you.
(1:39:38) In fact, many of the say the faces that you see behind me paid at least that. And after spending $135,000 on that work, the average business rated a 9.54 out of 10. It was a lot of work. And to be clear, these are experienced business owners. But numbers on a page can get overwhelming. So why don't we just ask them if they thought it was worth it? So, if you guys could use the incredibly scientific method of holding your fingers up from 1 to 10, one being bad, 10 being great, could you tell everyone who's watching whether it was worth it? Can I get some Can I get some fingers?
(1:40:21) So, don't believe me, believe them. So, why would I give away such an unstoppable machine? Well, let's not pretend that I'm just giving this away because I'm not. There's a catch. But before I tell you, books, experiences, tutors changed my life more than anything. Which is why I want to get these books in the hands of every entrepreneur in America and eventually the world.
(1:40:51) And if you're already donating 200 bucks and see how this AI tool is more valuable than anyone off consulting that people even pay $135,000 for and will give you hilariously more value than hiring another mid-level employee or vendor with a fraction of the experience and is way faster than trying to figure out everything for yourself through years of trial and error.
(1:41:14) And again, to put this in perspective, not even counting that this AI is trained on all three of my books, all 12 of the implementation playbooks, the leads playbooks, the sales playbooks, the profit playbooks, the delivery playbooks, and $31 million of real cash value advisory work alone, and more than two years of my life meeting with businesses one-on-one, day in and day out.
(1:41:33) And before I tell you the additional books you need to donate to get this free, let me ask you a question. How much is knowing exactly what to do with your business worth to you? How much is getting the right strategy without years of trial and error worth to you? How much is having the answer to your biggest business problem in minutes to your exact specifications worth to you? How much is unlimited access to intelligence that never sleeps worth to you? donating an extra thousand books, 2,000 books, 5,000 books, 30,000 books. Hold that number in your head for real.
(1:42:10) Actually think about the number like what it what would what amount of books would you be willing to donate for that? If you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt this custom trend AI would help you solve your biggest constraint, which you can't because all business involves risk and your execution will vary.
(1:42:32) But if it did, wouldn't it be worth at least that much? So, if I price this with 2500 more books on top of the 200, I think it would be beyond reasonable. 2500 more books to get $31 million of consulting value at your fingertips. And that's why the ACQAI is definitely a bargain at not 2500, but a thousand more books. And consider this.
(1:42:57) If all this did was give you the one solution to the problem that's been holding you your back your business back for years or allow you to see an opportunity from the outside of your industry that lets you leaprog all your competition or save your business from one catastrophic mistake.
(1:43:13) If all this did was give you the confidence to make your next big move knowing it's built on a foundation of hundreds of real world businesses like yours. Wouldn't it be worth it? I think so too. Which is why it's an even bigger bargain at not a thousand books, but 400 more books. Because even if only one single time you get one actionable answer to your exact specification with 10 times the clarity at 100 times the speed, it's the same thing these highle amazing business owners paid $135,000 for.
(1:43:42) And they did that because you only get to that level by understanding the value of risk and speed. And the best part is you only invest once but get to leverage it to your exact specifications as many times as you want. Which is why leverage like skills is one of the best investments. Look, if I had taken that $31 million from consulting and just parked it somewhere, it'd just be a pile of money.
(1:44:09) Who cares? But instead, I took two years of my life and the fruits of all that labor and put it into an AI tool that you can use. So, which would you rather have? 400 books worth of cash or the help you need to get to where you want to go with the custom ACQAI train on everything 247 on demand. Right. Me, too.
(1:44:33) Which is why this may really be the best offer I've ever given at not 400 extra bucks, but only 200 extra. And because I want each and every one of you truly serious ultra ballers to have an unfair advantage to 2x, 5x, or 10x your business over time. And I know how game-changing having the right answer at the right time has been for me. And I want this to be within your financial means, but still a serious decision.
(1:44:58) I'm not going to ask you to donate 400 more bucks. I'm not even going to ask you to donate 200 more bucks. And given this tool adds clarity, structure, speed, volume, and wisdom, it only makes sense that this has a real cost. And it only makes sense to do right by everyone who's ever invested in the development of this project. all these amazing people behind me.
(1:45:26) Which is why I'm going to give you access to the ACQAI custom trained on everything for an extra donation of an extra one time book donation of free with the original 200 book donation. So, yes, it's all included when you donate 200 books. As my way of saying thank you to all the players for putting books in the hands of entrepreneurs who need them. You guys are all amazing.
(1:46:03) So, let me quickly recap what you're getting when you donate 200 books at go.acq.com. And if you're like, should I go now? You should go now. Here's what you're getting. You donate 200 books to entrepreneurs in need. That's $5,9998 in absolute clear, unquestionable value. On top of that, you're getting the lead system to solve your leads constraints.
(1:46:22) If you're not getting as many qualified prospects as you need, we created these literal checklists and scripts to follow to solve the constraint free, the hooks, the good ads branding, and the marketing machine. Next, you get the sales system, which includes lead, nurture, closing, and the proof checklist. So, if right now you're not converting as many people and they're not converting as fast as you want, this is what it's for.
(1:46:42) free all of it. Next, you have the delivery system. If delivery is your constraint, you're not making you're not making enough profit per customer, LTV needs to expand or people are just churning out the back end. These checklists help you solve that problem. Both of these free. And you get the profit system, fast cash pricing, and the price letter.
(1:47:02) Things you can immediately do in your business tomorrow to prove how sales are perceived and how you can price that could ultimately drive the most profit. Not a promise, just saying that's how it works. all four of those systems free, plus the ACQ AI trained on $31 million of consulting that took me two years to build and put together so that I could train this AI on the best first-party data I possibly could free when you help me help other entrepreneurs by donating 200 bucks.
(1:47:32) But I've got one more free gift for you guys when you do the ACQ virtual implementation workshop. And you're like, "Does Alex have a prop for this?" Hell yeah. I have a prop for this. Boom. Look at that. That look nice. Looks nice, doesn't it? All right. There we go. To make sure you use the AI the to the best of its ability, I want to walk you through the same process that people pay 35,000 or even 135,000 for and love it. So, when you donate 200 bucks, you'll also get the ACQ implementation virtual
(1:48:05) workshop. So, I'll be personally leading you through the entire implementation process to find the playbook that will give you the highest return today, which one yielding next, and how to best use ACQA to implement it. At the virtual workshop, you'll identify which constraint gives you the maximum return on effort using our most effective frameworks to help you use ACQA to find and create leverage.
(1:48:30) You'll pinpoint whether your bottleneck is demand or supply and then install what I call quad promotional funnels that allow you to scale across both sides of the business. You'll leave with a clear road map showing which playbook to start with for maximum impact. Personalized by the ACQAI for your exact business. The result, you'll get clear on what's holding you back, then know which playbooks to use to solve the issue and unlock what I call leverage growth and use ACQA to maximize it.
(1:48:56) So, if the playbooks are your map, think of the ACQA as your vehicle and think of the workshops as your guide. Now, to put this in context, an in-person version of this is $35,000 run by my team. All right? So, I'm not involved. $35,000 run by my team in person one day. This experience is virtual and it's led by me. Now, here's just a few happy stories of the inerson one run by my team.
(1:49:21) Joshua Tomlinson, I followed Alex's concept for a long time. Expectations super high. Needless to say, absolutely delivered. Happy Bay Construction. We've never been to event pack with so much value in two days. Uh, no fluff, straight business, worth every penny. Uh Sarah, been to Vegas twice now.
(1:49:33) Can say without hesitation, help my business tremendously. Mike Lynch, one of the best highle business events I've ever been to. Highly recommend for every business owner. Julie, nearly instant ROI ROI every time I come here. They go above and beyond to make sure you get exceptional value. And there's just honestly the best things we've ever done. Uh it just you can keep going.
(1:49:49) Left with clarity, bunch of great notes, some solid connections, great fly, right? I can keep definitely do it again. Recommend a friend. Like I can keep going. There's just a lot of these.

(1:51:11) But I also know that some of you still have a question or two. So, before I bring out our five mystery headliners, let me address some of the questions I expect people to have. So, let me just be upfront. This is a significant commitment, right? So, let me just be direct here.
(1:51:29) If you've gotten value from my free nuggets, my free YouTube videos, my free podcast, my free scaling roadmap, my free audio books, my free keynotes, my free newsletter, Mosy Minute, my free courses, my free events.

(1:51:54) With that said, while you guys check out, I want to share something cool with you. Over the last year, I've been studying riskreward decision-making frameworks of the wealthiest people in history. People like Rockefeller, Paul Getty, Bezos, Musk. And what amazed me was a common theme. These guys had to make huge bets and go allin multiple times. And those moments are the inflection points in their lives and wealth.
(1:52:19) For example, Elon, age 26, exits first business, Zip 2, gets 22 million bucks in cash. Most people retire here, but then he goes all in on his next thing, a payment platform. 31, exits PayPal, 175 million in cash to him. Most people for sure retire here, but he then goes all in again on his next thing, rocket cars, and solar.
(1:52:39) Then age 37, SpaceX almost runs out of money. Puts everything he has on the line on his fourth launch, makes it happen, and SpaceX is saved. But wait, there's more. At age 46, Tesla's one month from running out of money. He risked his entire net worth again to borrow money to float the company and eventually turns the corner with the Model S.
(1:52:58) And today, 54, now the richest man in the world with three of the most valuable companies ever and position for more growth. And all of the others have the same wild stories because they have a different and superior understanding of risk and reward. Basos actually has two of my favorite quotes on risk and reward of all time. The first was the opener of my $100 million offers book.
(1:53:17) Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom. And conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a 10% chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time, but you're still going to be wrong nine times out of 10. We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot. But you're also going to hit some home runs.
(1:53:37) The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score a thousand runs. This longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold.
(1:53:54) Big winners pay for so many experiments. He also has my second favorite quote of his. It's short and sweet, but it's one that I think of a lot, partially because I don't read paragraphs to myself. Uh, humans tend to overestimate risk and underestimate opportunity, which led to one conclusion. History rewards us for being bold.
(1:54:14) Because I know some of you guys are stuck trying to figure out your next move, scaling like crazy, trying to keep the wheels on the bus, and some of you guys are just trying to stop the bleeding.
(1:54:26) And I've noticed this common theme for myself in business is that at every sticking point I reach, there's usually some big bet I have to make to get to the next level. And so I like to remind myself of this when I don't feel courageous. And so each of these figures had moments where they to make high stakes decisions multiple times, not just once, multiple times, and go all in to get to the next level.
(1:54:44) And since decisions are the highest leverage actions that we can take, I thought sharing some of the decision frameworks and bets that shape my career might be some of the highest leverage value that I can give you. Is that okay? I think they're cool. Sweet. 10 decisions and frameworks that changed my life. So, big decision number one was quitting my job to become an entrepreneur. So, I'm on the phone with a close friend, Victor.
(1:55:09) He was my first free client, by the way. Uh, pacing around my apartment probably for the 50th time, debating if I should quit my job and start a business or not. And so, I'm saying things like, you know, what if it doesn't work? What if I run out of money? You know, I'm doing okay. Why should I change anything? I've got a lot going on already. Uh, you know, things are super busy right now.
(1:55:28) And like a good friend, he listened and he waited for me to list all my reasons. And then he said something I'll never forget. He said, 'Dude, the only thing that's guaranteed is that if you risk nothing, you get nothing. It sounds like all your reasons not to do it are the reasons you should do it.
(1:55:44) And what's crazy is we actually both quit our jobs after that conversation with the next few weeks. And I drove across the country to become an entrepreneur. And I can safely say that was the best decision I ever made. and my friend Victor helped me, which led me to big decision number two, learning the gym business. So, I drive across the country.
(1:56:01) This is the actual picture when I got to California, when I actually showed up. Um, so I find this gym expert on the internet, drive across the country, straight to his gym, and I took this picture. I actually found it. I think it's kind of cool. Um, and so anyways, after driving 36 hours, I didn't know what to expect. And so, as soon as I sit down, he offers me to join his gym owner group for $10,000. So, I froze.
(1:56:20) I'm 22 years old, right? I tell him, "Uh, I'm not sure if I'm at the point in my business career to make an investment like this." But Sam says to me, "Have you ever made a decision like this before?" I say, 'N no. He says, 'You only have to answer three questions, and if you answer no to any of them, then don't do it. Deal? I said, sure.
(1:56:38) He said, "Will this get you closer further from your goals?" I said, "Yes." He said, "Great." He said, "Does it increase your chances versus doing it on your own?" Yes or no? He said, "Yes." He said, "Do you have access to the money to get started?" "Yes or no." Said, "Yes." He said, 'Well, since you said yes to all three, it's a logical decision. So, I don't think you'll regret it. And so, I did it.
(1:56:57) I invested in me, and it ended up being one of the best decisions, the best investments I've ever made. It was the first big domino that moved me in this direction. And to be clear, that one group isn't why I'm here today. But the decision to invest in learning skills is it was the first big investment I made.
(1:57:13) So, I always frame these decisions directionally rather than absolutely. So instead of asking will this thing scale save XYZ my business answer it certainly won't only you can do that but instead I ask does this get me closer or further from my goals and for me when the answer is yes I move forward knowing I'll figure the rest out along the way which you can do by going to the link below at go.acq.
(1:57:34) com and despite being terrified to spend that kind of money I did and that decision ended up being one of the largest factors to why I'm here today. So, here's what happened next. I go to my first gym owners meeting. Remember, I don't own a gym, okay? And so, big decision number three.
(1:57:53) What kind of gym model should I start? Bodybuilding, powerlifting, fitness. I was into all these different things. And so, I show up the meeting. I wasn't even sure if I was ready to be in a room like this. And I and my turn to talk comes up. So, I say, you know, I want to start a 10,000 foot gym. And immediately all the gym owners jump on me and were like, never go over 5,000 feet for a training studio. I was like, oh, okay, got it. Write it down.
(1:58:11) And then I mentioned some specific equipment I wanted to get and they said, "No, you don't need that. You can get most of that stuff for 10 cents on the dollar at auctions." I was like, "Oh, didn't know that. Great." And then I said, "Okay, well, I want to rent retail space. Five bucks a foot is what I'm thinking." They're like, "No, you can never go above 150." I was like, "Oh, got it.
(1:58:25) " And so in 30 minutes, they saved me probably five years and $250,000. Like, I couldn't have gotten a higher ROI if I tried. And that's when I realized just how steep the price of ignorance is. It's a tax we all pay in time or money, and we pay with whatever we value least. But we pay the ignorance tax either way.
(1:58:45) These decisions, to be clear, I made before I was ready, but I think of them now like a rocket ship. A small directional change in the beginning can create huge changes down the line, good or bad. So sometimes starting before you're ready is exactly when you benefit the most.
(1:59:04) It's also why I secured financing through a firm which works out to $249 a month for anyone who qualifies and wants to donate books. Just remember, check out his guest if you want to use financing. To be clear, don't be dumb. I've tried to make it so anyone who's motivated to donate can and can get it. Just hit the link at the bottom now. You can walk through the steps. All right.
(1:59:22) Anyways, the decisions that Sam and that group helped me make set me on this better path, which led me to big decision number four, starting with my first gym and my partner who never was. So Sam connects me with another gym owner in the area and says, "We should partner up and start a bigger gym together." So, two weeks before the gym opens, my 2B partner says, "Hey, we should go to this workshop. It's $3,000.
(1:59:41) They promise uh if if you don't make $10,000 at the end of the workshop, you can get your money back." I was like, "Okay." So, $3,000 was still a lot to me at the time, but it sounded like stuff I needed to learn. So, I paid and I went to with him to uh Las Vegas. So, let me give you a spoiler here. I didn't make 10 grand.
(1:59:58) I didn't even make a dollar from the workshop, but I did learn a little skill called Facebook ads in 2012. So, this is totally crazy. But that arrow that's pointing to that picture, so a friend of mine was actually there. He sent me this picture, I want to say within the last six months. And this is from 2012, so 13 years ago. So he was there and this is actually at the workshop. Anyways, I think for me it's cool.
(2:00:15) I mean, maybe when you go get older, you you know, you like pictures that you of little moments. So anyways, my 2B partner uh didn't make $10,000 either. All right, but here's the difference. He got upset and he asked for a refund, but I didn't because I saw how I could use this to get people into my gym.
(2:00:33) Now, the night before we had to sign the lease, my 2B partner, who never was, backed out. So, I had to come up with his half and my half, which is why I didn't have enough for two rents and slept on the floor. For those of you who know that story, that's why. But learning to run ads in exchange for my $3,000 investment, yeah, you can see it worked out for me in the long run. And so, the bottom line is this.
(2:00:54) For the right person, ROI should be the least of their concerns. Because to winners, learning skills is always worth it. And winners only become winners by taking action before they are. And that's how they win. But if you just need to take a bet on yourself, then do it. You're the only asset you can ever lose.
(2:01:14) And so investing in you is the best long-term move you can make with this or anything. And I made it easy for you at go.acq.com. Now, that takes me to big decision number five. find a way or make a way. So, I open my gym and I I get a chairs and table from a dealership down the street for free. So, they put these out on their lawn. You can see a picture there.
(2:01:32) Um I like I just only bought equipment and then I realized that no one had anywhere to sit and I had nowhere to sign anyone up and so I was like, "Oh god." And so I saw this out front of this car dealership and they're like, "You want it?" And so they actually helped me bring it back. Anyways, little story. Um so I pull these things from across the street for free. Uh I run my first ads and I sign up 22 members.
(2:01:51) And this sounds silly now, but like that table with 22 signups was actually a huge accomplishment to me. Um, for years when I would look at that picture, I used to get really choked up about it. U, now I feel nothing. I'm kidding.
(2:02:08) Uh, but I actually remember it was a huge I went to a new city I'd never been to and I signed up 22 people. It was like a huge deal. And so what's interesting is that one of those members totally changed my perspective. Her name was Jamie. And so she was a single mom, four kids, one job, comes in, says she wants to lose weight. I told her the price. She said she couldn't afford it. And so I paused, as you should.
(2:02:27) And then she finally said, "You know what? I'm going to do it anyways. I'll figure it out." And so she ended up crushing it and doing awesome job. And so later I asked her, I said, "Hey, what'd you end up doing to pay for this so that I could tell other people, right, who said they they can't afford it?" She said, "I drove Uber one day a week when the kids were at their dads. I was just resourceful.
(2:02:44) " And so in that moment, she taught me the difference between resources and resourcefulness. Everyone thinks you need the first, but you only need the second. And as a single mom with four kids, you can imagine she could have easily said she didn't have the money. But it just came down to priorities. She just decided that this was more important than the least important thing she was doing and spending money on and made the trade.
(2:03:04) And so sometimes I have to remind myself of that where I'm like, what is do I want this thing? Yes. What else am I spending time and money on? What is the least important thing that I'm spending time and money on? Am I willing to trade that for this other thing that I want more? If the answer is yes, I make the trade.
(2:03:23) And so, whenever I like to think of my situation, if I think it's hard, right? I think about Jamie and I'm reminded that there's always someone who's had it worse and done better. And I actually found one of her first pro progress pictures and she actually ended up losing over, I think, close to 100 pounds. This isn't her full before and after, but I just thought it was kind of cool.
(2:03:39) Um, just, you know, little history. And she did that by focusing on her resourcefulness, not her resources. And the best way to increase resourcefulness is to learn new skills. It's why I distilled all the practices into playbooks and checklists. You can just follow them. Each playbook you can get through in one sitting. That's how I designed them.
(2:03:56) This is not the time of of more information. This is time of how do I just have the checklist that I can follow that can implement to immediately see a change. And it took me time that you don't have to pay to figure out the hundred ways to do it wrong.
(2:04:14) With these playbooks, you can just start with what works so you stop wasting time what doesn't by donating 200 books at the link below. Which led me to big decision number six, learning high ticket sales and services. So my gym's growing but not fast enough. So I reached back out to the guy who ran the workshop. He had like 10 gyms at the time and I asked him, you know, can you help me grow my gyms faster? He said, sure.
(2:04:33) And then told me the largest price I'd ever heard. And of course, my initial reaction was, "Ah, I'm not so sure." So, he says to me, "I'm not here to convince you to spend money you don't have. My goal is to help you save time you haven't spent. You're going to have to figure this out to get to where you want to go. So, you're going to buy these lessons either way.
(2:04:51) And everything you're telling me is that your business isn't growing fast enough. So, you're already paying for this with time. So, the question is, is that how you want to still pay?" because you can pay with time or money, but only one of them you can get back, which is why I made this to save you time and money.
(2:05:15) If you're ready to avoid the ignorance tax, the only kind of legal tax, by the way, that you can avoid, you can go to go.acq.com. So, anyways, I do it. I make the investment. I fly across the world and I learned about semi-privates and how to sell higher ticket services. And you could say that investment worked out pretty good. And by the way, I actually went there. He was super busy and he had his secretary.
(2:05:41) He said, "Hey, can you just take this guy out for the day?" So, I have 57 pictures of me in Australia in random places, just me alone, where they took pictures. Then, I met up with him later that evening uh so he could teach me all this stuff. So, just a fun story. So, that led me to big decision number seven, going allin on the skills needed for gym launch. So, at this point, I only know how to run ads locally. I need to learn how to run them globally.
(2:05:59) And I reached out to a bunch of ad agencies, but I couldn't afford their services. And so, finally get on the phone with one guy and I asked if he'll just tutor me. He says no. But I was so desperate. I was like, what would it take? Which, by the way, a way better question to ask yourself and others if you truly want something. But anyways, he says, way more than I was prepared for.
(2:06:17) So, I hesitated. And so, he says, "Think about it like this. Over the next 12 months, you're going to spend this money either way. That money's already gone. So, it's not about spending it. It's about where it goes. So, you're going to keep spending it on stuff that doesn't move the needle, ads that flop, leads you waste, sales you don't close, hires that don't deliver, or you can exchange it for something that builds your business because money only has value when it's exchanged for something better. And what's a better trade than the skills you need to build the business you want?
(2:06:45) So, I did it and I became the best student I possibly could and learned what I needed to advertise B2B and start launching gyms, which ended up being one of the best investments I ever made. And my hope is to provide the same opportunity for you and 200 other entrepreneurs which you can support by donating books at the link below.
(2:07:03) Again, your life will be different from mine. So we results. I share this to explain how I made my decisions that changed my life and make big bets when I wasn't sure what to do. Not to guarantee an outcome for yours, which led to big decision number eight. My next big bet on skills. So fast forward, gym launch works, but we've plateaued for three years.
(2:07:22) I'm stuck at 30 million plusish a year. And I get on this podcast and I start, you know, to talk about a company I'm a huge fan of. And the host of the podcast says that the founder is a personal friend of his and he can make an intro. So I asked him to and he did. And at the time the founder said his company was doing a billion a year in sales.
(2:07:41) This guy was the richest person I ever spoken to at the time. So he talked for a while and I asked him what he thought I should do to get unstuck. So he tells me, "It sounds like you just need a different way to advertise.
(2:07:53) " So, I immediately counter with him like, "Hey, well, I've tried some stuff in the past before and it didn't work out. So, I'm not sure if that'll work. Let me just see how my current initiatives are shaking out. I got some coals in the fire. Let me see how those work out." Now, this guy doesn't need to help me. But he just drops this bomb on me instead.
(2:08:11) He says, "If you've done something like this in the past and it didn't work, the only thing worse than making one bad investment is letting a bad investment prevent you from making a good one. And if you do, you let it burn you twice. He says, "Listen, imagine you could go back in time and talk to your younger self opening your first gym." I say, 'Yeah, okay. So, he continues, "Would you have things to tell him about what to do differently?" I was like, "Yeah, of course.
(2:08:35) " He said, "Right, but now imagine younger you doesn't listen and says, I'm super busy right now. I've got some initiatives I want to take care of. I've got some coals in the fire. It's not a priority. I'll get to it later." You get it? He said, ' That's what I'm trying to do for you right now.
(2:08:53) You're only hesitant because you can quantify what you have to lose, but not what you stand to gain. And that's why making big bets is so hard and why so few people make them. So, I made the investment of time and money into content. It's been one of the best investments I've ever made. And so, if you're feeling any of the same hesitations, that might be your business telling you exactly what it needs.
(2:09:16) Because it isn't about the timing being perfect. It's about solving what's making the timing feel imperfect. And if that sounds logical, go donate some books. If it doesn't, that's cool, too. Which led me to big decision number nine. So, there are moments in your life where everything branches, right? You probably think of some of these now.
(2:09:34) If I hadn't gone to that coffee shop or signed up for XYZ class, you know, this thing wouldn't have happened. For me, one happened eight and a half years ago when I was swiping on my phone during lunch. So, I saw this fit Persian chick and figured why not? But what's crazy is that if I had swiped the other way, I wouldn't have met her. And I shuddered to think what my life would be without Leila in it.
(2:09:54) And I think about this a lot because without her, I wouldn't be where I am today. The thing is is there's a version of you six months or six years from now looking back on this moment wondering what if I hadn't taken that step? What if I hadn't gotten what I needed? What if I hadn't learned that one thing that completely unlocked the business growth for me? What if I had repositioned my offer in a way that allowed more people to want to buy it? More people to be interested, my sales people to sell. All of a sudden, all of a sudden, way more people are showing up. I'm getting more clicks in. Again, not a promise, but imagine if these
(2:10:19) things could happen. If you went back to this moment, you're like, "Man, I I can't imagine what would happen if if I hadn't done that." Which is why it's worth taking the leap and being bold. So, if you feel like taking a leap and being bold, go donate books, help two other 200 other entrepreneurs, and you can get all this that you can see. Which brings me to one of the biggest leaps we made together.
(2:10:43) Decision number 10, buying this building, which I'm actually in right now. So, we weren't sure if it made sense for us to get a building and definitely not this big given the nature of the business at the time, right? We just, you know, it was a holding company. And when we were considering the decision, we came down to this framework.
(2:11:00) When we're old, will this matter? Well, if it doesn't work out, it changes nothing. But if it does, it changes everything. So imagine you're old, you're looking back on your life, you're like, "Well, is me buying this building or not buying this building, is it really going to change it?" Probably not.
(2:11:17) But if we do, and then all of a sudden all of these things flourish. It changes everything. And so the downside is limited. We can sell the building, not a huge deal. We can sell the books, not a huge deal, but the upside is unlimited. We can turn this into a campus for talent, culture, team, clients, and build the life we want, which is a framework that we use a lot when thinking about big bets.
(2:11:41) What if it goes wrong? And what if it works? And no matter what, we figured we'd do what we always do if something bad happened. We figure it out. So, we let the investment be something that motivated us rather than made us hesitant because buying this building and now our second building have been some of the best investments we've made despite being unsure about it at the time. Turned out better than expected.
(2:12:01) And if you have questions about your business, that's why I made ACQA and why we're going to have a whole day dedicated to making sure you have exactly what you need at the ACQ virtual workshop. And so those are 10 decisions and frames that helped me make some of the biggest decisions in my life that paid off.
(2:12:19) Was that helpful for you? Is that helpful for you guys? Because I know some of you guys are stuck trying to figure out your next move, skiing like crazy, trying to keep the wheels on the bus. Some of you guys are just trying to stop the bleeding. And going all in, taking the leap may be the best thing you do.
(2:12:39) At least it has been for Rockefeller, Paul Getty, Basos, Musk, and it certainly has been for me. To be clear, I'm not saying what happened for me will happen for you. You can't make the same decisions as me. My life is unique. So is yours, and your results will be too. But to requestimate risk and underestimate opportunity. This longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold.
(2:13:05) Big winners pay for so many experiments. We're rewarded for being bold. That said, for those of you who are motivated to be bold and take action right now, I've got one more surprise gift for you for helping me help 200 other entrepreneurs, but it disappears the moment this live stream ends. The $100 million launch blackbook.
(2:13:36) It's available now only while this live stream is on. So while the red light is on, this is available. The moment the red light is off, it's gone. Most business owner most business owners are terrible at launching things. They post once on social media. They send a single email. Nobody cares and they wonder why.
(2:13:55) Then they watch their competitors with inferior products destroy them simply because they know how to create demand. I spent the last 14 years mastering the art of launches. From f flying city to city, launching gyms out of extended stays when I was dead broke to launching supplements that did 74 million in sales with four almost 400,000 orders to launching software that hit 15 million users to launching books that shattered records both topping the all of Amazon charts.
(2:14:23) Launching is how I built what I have. This launch that you're watching right now, I invested four million in ads alone to execute it. Just ads. And maybe just broke a world record. We'll see. Every email, every ad, every piece of content was strategically designed to create maximum engagement and maximum impact.
(2:14:48) So, here's everything I spent 14 years learning, two years assembling, and millions to create for this record-breaking launch. So, here's what you get inside the launch blockbook. You have the email and SMS sequences that drove hundreds of thousands of registrations. I checked this morning.
(2:15:06) I think our number right before I got up here was 620,000 video sales letters, six different VSSL scripts that converted cold traffic. There's all sorts of different ones and we'll give you the scripts for all of them. The affiliate recruitment, the complete blackbook and email and text sequences we used and the prizes, the whole breakdown for how we had affiliates also promote this paid ads, thousand plus paid ads that profitably scaled this launch. This complete webinar, this is 1,700 slides.
(2:15:32) Transcript and the production notes to make this happen. the launch timeline dayby-day blueprint for recreating this exact launch and something that I like I don't know if you'll appreciate unless you really get this launch memo. So what is a launch memo? So we we practice the same thing that Bas did at his company which is that we do all of our big decisions via memos. That's how we do it at acquisition.com.
(2:16:00) And so all argumentation, all structure, all big decisions are always done through memos. So, we have to crystallize our thoughts and just crystallize our decision-making process. And so, you'll get the launch memos, our internal documents that explain the strategy and the thinking behind the launch and the two book bundles, the 200 and the 800.
(2:16:16) The 800 you see after the 200. That's the big ultra business owner bonus. So, once you get 200, you can see the 800 one. Now, here's the reality. From launching a lemonade stand to launching the iPhone, every business of every size needs to launch stuff.
(2:16:35) You need to make your offers available from new products to new locations to new services to new features to new events. The difference between businesses that explode and businesses that die is their ability to channel demand into buying behavior. These assets work. The same psychology works whether you're launching a hundred to 100 people or to a thousand people. Let me see if I can get that. There we go. Or to 100,000 people.
(2:16:56) You're getting the exact multi-million dollar assets that just shattered hopefully unofficially a world record. but only if you donate while the live stream is on. The moment this live stream ends, it will no longer be available. So, this is your final chance to get the launch blackbook worth more to me than just about anything.
(2:17:18) So, if you want to master a core skill that built my material wealth and get everything we used to break records, go to go.acq.com right now before it's gone. Now, a special note. The live only bonus launch collateral is digital. And the main reason is this. We couldn't print it ahead because we're still doing the launch. All right. So, this offer won't be for sale after the launch. So, if you want it, you need to check out at the link below.
(2:17:42) Now, the implementation mega system, everything you can see here is first come, first serve. And so, when you help me on this mission, my hope is that I not only help you achieve yours, that we together can help 200 other entrepreneurs save their businesses, save the world.
(2:18:00) And so that's why I'm trying so hard and spent countless hours doing the unscalable, the sheer volume of work over two years. It's been insane to make this for you so that we could give this to them. So let me tell you everything you're getting when you support 200 entrepreneurs at go.acq.com. So, when you donate 200 bucks, which is a true $5,998 value, you're going to get the lead system, which includes the goed ads playbook, the hooks playbook, the branding playbook, the marketing machine playbook, so you can replace your face, the branding playbook, so you can actually build the brand that gets the clicks, that gets the sales at the premium prices that you want.
(2:18:33) You're also going to get the sales system, which includes lead nurture, closing, and the proof checklist. All three free. If people aren't buying fast enough or your sales team isn't closing or you're the only sales team, this is the solution for that problem.
(2:18:50) Next, we have the delivery system, which is we got to make them worth more. We got to get them to keep paying. And so, how do you do that? We have more analytics and more data on retaining customers than I think just about anyone because the nature of the companies that I own. And so, I put everything that we've learned from millions of dollars in research into here and organized into literal checklists.
(2:19:08) You can just follow them free when you donate 200 bucks. On top of that, you get the fast cash playbook, the pricing playbook, and the price race playbook. These are the fastest, lowest operational drag things you could immediately implement in the business to try and cover this donation. Not a promise that's going to happen.
(2:19:25) I'm just saying that these would be the things that I would start with if I was like, what do I do tomorrow? That's the least change that I can make in the business to try and generate cash flow. That's what I would do. So you get all all four of those systems free when you donate 200 bucks. Plus the HQAI trained on $31 million of consulting work. Every one of the faces you see behind me. $31 million of consulting work with 226 plus businesses probably multiple just like yours. You're like what should I do? Ask. It's why I did it for two years.
(2:19:49) and the ACQ virtual workshop that'll show you which playbook to start with, how to personalize it, and we'll show you how to use the tools to get to where you want to go. And while we're still live, we have the launch blackbook which contain contains everything that I spent millions of dollars on literally to put this together so that you can model it in whatever you want to launch whether it's new products, new locations, new services, new features, whatever. You can launch it using this free when you
(2:20:20) donate 200 books to other entrepreneurs at go.acq.com. And if you qualify through a firm, you can donate books to get everything in your hands for as little as $249 a month interest free. All right, this is if you qualify. And if you aren't seeing a firm, hit the little dots at the top right and you can check out as a guest. You can also check out as a guest at the bottom.
(2:20:38) And if you have any issues checking out, I hired and trained 300 phone reps. I kind of skipped over this earlier. We hired and trained 300 phone reps to make sure that anyone who wanted them could get them. So you'll see their number on any failed checkout. Just call them and they will help you. So let's talk about best case scenario.
(2:20:55) I think this one's pretty short because I think I've carted it pretty well. So, you change your life forever. Your business scales faster than you thought possible. Save the world, right? I think we're pretty straightforward on that one. But let's talk about worst case scenario. Right off the bat, you get a 100% dollar fordoll tax write off as a business.
(2:21:12) Period. First thing. Next, instead of just giving them away, if you wanted to, you could just resell all 200 for yourself and keep the bonuses free for life. This is again worst case scenario. That's the second thing. And to give you context here, we've sold 1.3 million copies of my book and we sell thousands every day. So, if you wanted to, there's demand for these books.
(2:21:38) So, they retain their value. You could also use these books as lead magnets to get more leads. actually had a business owner this morning saying, "Yeah, I'm just giving them as a lead magnet for my next event." I was like, "Great." Or as a gift to new customers or as a bonus for joining a community.
(2:21:58) You have an online community, want to give it as a gift for people joining or coming to an event, want to have books for people or if you want a customer, just leave a testimonial, leave a review, give a book as a bonus. Or, and this is actually one of the most common ones that I was not expecting, um, an onboarding gift for new employees to get them up to speed faster.
(2:22:15) One of the one of the biggest uh reasons we get bulk orders actually is companies buying the books to onboard all their new new employees. I didn't know that one. I didn't expect that one. And mind you, all of those things, those are all the worst case scenario before you even use a single tactic from all four of the system, the lead system, the sales system, the delivery system, the profit system.
(2:22:33) And that's before asking even a single question to get the ACQ AI adviser to do anything. That's before the value multiplication you get from the ACQ workshop. And that's before deploying even a single artifact from the launch blackbook. I feel like it's a pretty amazing worst case scenario. 100% tax deduction for businesses. You sell the books to recoup some of all the costs. Give it as a gift to new customers. You can use as a lead magnet.
(2:22:58) Use it as a gift to join a community like school. Use as onboarding uh training or for a new employee gift. Give it as a gift bonus at your next event meetup. Plus, you can also just feel good about helping 199 other entrepreneurs grow their businesses. As a reminder, for those of you who just want to do good, but don't want to take the time to give them away, I will gladly handle the distribution of the books. So, if you want to use just some of them, uh, just use the code that you get in your email to get free books. And
(2:23:21) whatever you don't use, I'll donate the rest for you. Keep it simple. Again, that was the number one request we had from last year. So, here's what happens next. Go to link at the bottom of the screen. Go. Go.acq.com. Hit this button. check out. And if you have issues checking out, call the number there. They will help you.
(2:23:47) And the larger business owners, which is about 15% of you here, there's a short video on the next page showing how you can get access to me for six months, meet each other, some other cool stuff if you choose to donate even more books. It's a one-time thing I'm only doing for this launch. There are more details on why I'm doing in the video.
(2:24:10) And I purposely did it this way to create a barrier so only someone who could spend that without needing a sales call or some sort of convincing would be in to increase the overall quality. And you can upgrade your order with a click and then check out. But you got to donate 200 bucks first to get that one. So do this first.
(2:24:29) But the launch bonus disappears the moment this live stream ends. So go to go.acq.com. Now is the time actually. Okay. We are interrupting. Okay. Because I brought some friends. Oh. To give you something. No There we go. Broke the record. We broke the record. Hi, Alec. Well, Oh, sir. I'm not supposed to cuss. My bad. Well, uh, shoot.
(2:25:03) Um, so I I'll tell you guys, uh, we, so I set this record, you know, I set this goal because I wanted to, the idea of putting a book in the in every entrepreneur's hands in America was something that was really dear to me because, um, this was like everything I have is because of of things I've learned and because of other people who decided to write it down.
(2:25:22) And I thought, man, if I bought a if I built a brand that was like everything instead of instead of trying to hide it, just like just put everything out there, all the details, like it would have been amazing if Basos and Musk and like I've had to glean all these things from their tiny interviews, but but I was like, how could I just put this out there and just build a brand based on that? And so um what was really crazy is that when I looked at the non-fiction um book sales records, so this is kind of crazy, but of the top 10, nine of them are politicians. And I thought to myself, I was like, and
(2:25:48) of both parties, so it's not a it's it's both parties. And I was like, how is it that the the top 10 non-fiction, you know, books are all written by people who basically had state sponsoring and the people who are paying those bills is us. We're the entrepreneurs. We're the ones doing it.
(2:26:07) And so I was like, man, one of us should should get that. And so part of the reason I did this was was for that. I was like, one of us should should have like it's all of ours. I don't like I take this as all of ours. this is not mine. Like I couldn't have done this without you, which is why I said that to begin with is like how could I have you help me make this happen for everyone. Um so this is really award for you guys.
(2:26:25) Thank you guys so much. You guys are awesome. And thank you guys so much. Of course, as you know, this record is continuing for 24 hours. It is quite an official officially amazing achievement to have surpassed the record already so soon into the 24-hour launch. So, we will get that final number um tomorrow morning and see where your final number is, but we can confirm the three of us that you are the official new record holder. Congratulations. Thank you.
(2:26:57) So, thanks guys. So, just so you guys know, the I think the record was 1.44 something like that. 1.43. Yeah. 1.43 million copies sold. Um we're serious. We want to hit that record. We want to get that Sorry. We want to get the books into the into the hands of uh as many entrepreneurs in America as we can. And you know, we're not stopping. So, let's keep powering through. I got more stuff to show you.
(2:27:20) And um I can't wait. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I think we should probably transition to to prizes. Yeah. All right. So, without further ado, $100 million men, please remove the the table from the premises. And we're going to transition to uh to one more one more promise that I need to deliver on.
(2:27:45) And I have a thing on my shoe. There we go. All right. You're good. All right. So, we're going to close down this live stream uh with a moment that many of you guys have been waiting for, prizes. So, some of you guys pre-ordered or referred friends or both for a shot to win prizes.
(2:28:09) And I first off, I want to say thank you. I think we both want to say thank you for that. Um, and so as soon as I finish calling the names, this live stream will be over and the launch bonus will be gone forever. So, if you've been on the fence about like, should I donate books, when should I do it, now is the time. Oh, thank you.
(2:28:26) Good call for that. Yes. Put this right here. Of course. What did you get? All right, I'll do with that later. All right. And so if you choose to donate 200 plus other books to other entrepreneurs and help me on my mission to get these books in everyone's hands, here's what you guys are going to get.
(2:28:43) So when you donate the 200, you're going to get the lead system in all three playbooks for free. You're going to get the sales system, all four playbooks to help you convert more prospects for free. The delivery system for free, the uh profit system for free in all four playbooks.
(2:29:01) So whether you're struggling to get leads, struggling to convert them, struggling to deliver to them, or you're doing the first three and you're just not making enough every month, we've created multiple playbooks because we had to encounter these with so many different businesses across different industries and we had to solve these problems. And so we created these playlists to solve the problems. You get all 12 for free.
(2:29:20) On top of that, you get the ACQA, which is trained with over $31 million of consulting, which took over two years of my life. Um Ila also sacrificed a little bit of our marriage in order to to let me to let me do this. Um because it was it was it was a huge commitment. It was a huge commitment. Um and I mean you could see it like this was so much work.
(2:29:37) Um and it was because we wanted to deliver something amazing. We wanted to get books in the hands of everyone and I was like I had to create the craziest incentive of all time. And beyond that to make sure that you have an amazing experience with the HQI trained on everything. the notes that uh that that I have on the books that were never published, the notes I have in the playbooks that were never published, and these notes themselves.
(2:29:55) Uh you'll also get the ACQ virtual workshop where we'll basically train you on how to use the tools the way we use the tools because this is not like, oh, this is a just use it like GPT. That is not how you use it. That's not how you use these types of tools. It's going to be more specific. We'll show you how to get the most out of it so you can get the most leverage.
(2:30:11) These are tools and you need skills to wield them. And beyond that, uh, this launch just broke the world record for the the fastest selling non-fiction book in history, uh, beating I don't want to I don't want to drop names because I don't want to get, you know, blacklisted by the government.
(2:30:29) But, uh, George Bush's book was number five at 220,000 books. Bill Clinton was uh, number four at 400,000 books. Michelle Obama uh, had 700 and 700 and something 750,000 books. Um, I think Barack Obama had 887,000 that he had. Um, and Prince Harry of the UK had 1.43 million copies that he sold in 24 hours. And, uh, we, this collection, this community of entrepreneurs, we just beat them all.
(2:30:58) So, thank you guys so much. Uh, and so the way that that was able to happen, all the assets that actually broke the record of the largest launch of all time are in here in this launch blackbook. And you will only get them right now while we are live. The moment the live stream is done, it will go away.
(2:31:18) And all of that is free when you donate 200 books. All right? Uh, and the donation's $5,998. And for everyone who's in the US and qualifies through a firm, it's 249 bucks a month, uh, interest free. Obviously, if you don't qualify, might have more interest. That's between you and a firm.
(2:31:36) All right, with that being said, uh, quick reminder, the live only launch, right, goes away the moment this ends. It contains the emails, video sales letters, recruitment, uh, for affiliates, paid ads. This complete webinar, all 1700 slides, the internal launch memos. So, go to the link at the bottom of the screen if you want to get yours now because it disappears the moment this live stream ends. All right.
(2:31:54) So, as also a friendly reminder, everyone here gets uh all the free stuff that I gave at the beginning. On Tuesday, that's when this will drop. Uh so stay tuned for that. Uh again, everyone who is here live will get a separate email with the lost chapters. Uh it'll be separate because you guys are here live. So just check your email for that.

(2:40:45) All the free stuff comes on Tuesday. You'll get the money model system free, lost chapters free, money models audiobook free, 90 days of school for free, and a lifetime lower rate of $9 a month. This was one of the big reasons we put money into the school so we could fix the money model so we could increase cash flow in the business so we could do this kind of thing.
(2:41:03) This has been the goal since Sam and I talked about this gosh almost two years ago when we first actually it's been over two years since we first started talking about doing this. It was like how can we get this to the point? how we keep driving the price down so we can just get more people who want to start businesses about things they're passionate about so they can how they can build communities, connect people together.
(2:41:22) I'm a huge believer like a lot of the big breakthroughs I had in my life came from like I said books, experiences and tutors and school allows people to share the things that they're good about or learn the things they want to learn. Um so like all of that is for free and already has all of the money model stuff trained into it. Um and so it's yours for free 90 days and then it's nine bucks a month after that.
(2:41:39) Okay, that's all going to be in your email. And if you choose to donate 200 other books, tell other entrepreneurs while we're here. Bring it at home. While you check out, here's what you're going to get. When you donate 200 bucks, you'll get the lead system, which includes goed ads, hooks, branding, and marketing machine absolutely free.
(2:41:56) You're going to get the sales safe, which has lead nurture, closing, and the proof checklist absolutely free. You're going to have the delivery system, which includes lifetime value enhancement and retention. So, if you got holes in the bucket, this will help you fill it for free. You've got the profit implementation system which includes fast cash pricing and price raise letter. These things are things you could immediately use tomorrow.
(2:42:15) Low operational drag to help even pay for this donation. Not a promise that's going to happen. Your results will be different. All right. But these are the things that I would do first if I had to. All right. You get all 12 of these playbooks, all four systems absolutely free when you donate 200 bucks.
(2:42:34) And I spent two years training this AI on 226 individual businesses, probably including not just one but multiple just like yours, of what we would do to scale the business, increase the the the the value of the assets itself, make it so the that the entrepreneur can ultimately exit the company, make it as valuable as possibly can and ultimately scale it.
(2:42:52) And we trained on $31 million of consulting, two years, so many so many late nights of putting these notes together, reviewing them, the full days that I would do with all of these different companies. And we trained it so that we could create something that could scale, that could help more people. And to make sure that you can use the tools like a master, so you actually can use them in a way that provides the most value to the business right out of the box.
(2:43:12) It takes time to learn skills that uh use tools that are more complex. We'll show you how to use the tools. And for those of you who have constraints in the business that are on supply side of like how do I get more people in the business? How do I get how do I attract some of the better talent is gonna be going over this stuff at the ACQ virtual workshop so we can help you deconstrain the business? Use the tools and make sure that we help you get that business over the hump that you're currently at. And the live only bonus,
(2:43:36) the launch blackbook that just broke the Guinness World Record goes away the moment this live stream ends. All right. All right, the email and SMS sequences that drove hundreds of thousands of registrations, the every video sales letter, the affiliate recruitment, the paid ads that we ran, a thousand plus paid ads that scaled this launch, this complete webinar, 1,700 slides that just broke the record all time.
(2:44:02) Uh the internal launch memos that explain the strategy behind every single big decision we had to make. It's all free, but it goes away the moment this live stream ends, which is momentarily. So, you're getting all of that live only for free and you can you can donate the books for $249 a month with a firm if you qualify in the US. Now, to the Super Ballers, you can grab my extra goodies on the next page by donating more books.
(2:44:26) Like I said earlier, uh you can donate 800 bucks, but I think it's only 3,000 more today. Um now, our 10th of 10 VIP winners. So, our final winner. Do you want to announce it? Yeah. Maybe who says it faster? We'll see who reads faster. You read faster. Luke Walton. That was an easy one. Luke, congratulations. Um, okay.
(2:44:50) So, as I close the live stream down, uh, launch blackbook goes away forever. Okay. So, if you're midcheckout, let me know. I'll keep the live stream uh going. Can I uh can I get the chat turned on so that I can see the other one because we have multiple chats going. I just want to make sure I see them all. Um, so uh if you're at checkout, let me know. I'll keep the live stream open just to make sure that uh you get your bonus.
(2:45:10) So, while you check out, that's everything that you get. And so, uh this is closing down momentarily. Now, I do have one more promise that I have to keep, but you said you want to do something, right? I'm about to do something crazy. So, what do you want to do? Go ahead. I'll do it after. Okay. All right. So, this is uh that is my shoe. This is for my Aussies.
(2:45:35) I promised I would uh do a Shuy for you guys since you guys are showing up at like 2 o'clock in the morning. Did you guys really give me a whole boy? Jesus, I don't even know if I could fit all the the beer in there. How am I going to fit all the beer in? So, this has been walked around in since 3:00 in the morning. I've been sweating. Yep. That's how a shoe works. And so, uh Yeah.
(2:46:02) So, to everyone, I promised I would do it. And so, you guys have been  awesome. Oh, man. I can see dirt in there. Oh, yeah. All right. Here we go. I'm going to do a beer's worth because this is a tall boy and I don't think he can fit inside of my shoe. Aussies, this is for you. You guys are awesome. Thank you guys. Get every last bit.
(2:46:40) All right. What did you want to do? We were just gonna uh we're going to stay on for a couple minutes, answer a couple questions, and then uh Oh, yeah. Show you a couple things. Oh, show me a couple things. Okay. Not that though. And probably not kissing. All right. What are we What are we doing? 2.4. Holy cow. You guys rock.
(2:47:06) 2.4 million copies. You guys are insane. We wanted to show you. Oh, thank you guys. Thank you guys. I mean, honestly, like this is all you guys. Um, you guys are awesome. Uh, I I really wanted to I meant what I said. like uh I saw the top the top list and nine out of the 10 were politicians and I was like how can these guys own the list for all non-fiction books when they're just memoirs that are ghostwritten.
(2:47:35) I was like the books aren't even written by them and I have no offense to those very powerful people. Please don't you know kill me. Um but like I was just like come on. And so I thought it would be awesome to give an incentive to allow business owners to donate to help other people out. like you can reach back in time and help your younger self by donating books. We'll handle all the distribution, all that stuff to make it easy.
(2:47:55) And so, yeah, let's do some effing A's and Q's. Yeah. So, we got some some A's and some Q's and some A's. So, we have Jackson Higgler. His business is Mr. Te's Pizza. Okay. It's a fast casual restaurant selling pizza and ice cream. Okay. One location generates 2.4 million in revenue, $850,000 in profit. Congrats. Freaking sick. Second location opening soon. Here's his question.
(2:48:18) At 22 years old, with a working model and strong cash flow, should I keep doubling down on opening restaurants or pivot cash flow to a higher multiple vehicle acquisitions, a scalable business to reach a $30 million net worth by age 30? How old is he? 22. 22. You know, man, I I think the monetary goals are, you know, it's a good thing, but I wouldn't like make it like letting the monetary goal be your decision for how you run the business. I don't think it's the right long-term perspective.
(2:48:50) That's what I was going to say, too. Yeah. I think it makes it less likely that you achieve your ult actually makes, ironically, makes you less likely to achieve your ultimate goal. Um, I think that I think you have to decide what kind of business you want to run. I will say that the you decrease the likelihood that you accomplish the objective with the the increased number of risk and variables you introduce to the system.
(2:49:11) And so if you have a working model right now that's doing 2.4 million with 30% margins, then you're going to want to like keep doing that as much as you possibly can. You want to add something? Yeah, I was just going to say it was interesting. I was studying why most startups fail.
(2:49:28) Um, and I was, you know, did a deep research with all my AI and it was talking about how it was like something like 70% of startups pivot too soon because they believe their model is unscalable. And because of that, when they pivot, they actually end up making less profit. And so, I think a lot of times what happens is that we do something and it's unscalable. And then we think, well, gosh, that was so hard. I don't want to do that again.
(2:49:46) I should pivot and try and do something more scalable and easy and that has more levers to pull. But the reality is that you get better with each time you do it. And we've actually seen this a lot with physical locations because a lot of people come in here and they're like oh gosh you know I've heard like I should go online I should do this. I should do that. And I tell my team for example like with acquisition.
(2:50:04) com I'm like great let them all do that and like we will keep doing what we're doing in our space. We will do what seems unscalable and we will make all of our we will make everything work from there because a lot of times what happens is that people pivot too soon because it seems too hard.
(2:50:18) And so I would say to you, one, if you just keep doing what you're doing, you're going to have a $30 million net worth by the age of 26. So like that's going to happen regardless. You're going to have the net worth. How do you want to get there and how do you want to feel? I think a lot of the times the biggest risk to an entrepreneur is not that you fail, it's that you quit.
(2:50:36) And you will quit if you hate the model, you hate the vehicle, and you hate the people you're doing it with. It's also very normal to always want things to go faster. And to then immediately assume that because it's not going faster, you're in the wrong vehicle. And it could be a money model issue. It could also just be a patience issue. And this isn't me trying to say like, "Oh, you're 22. Like, you're impatient, but like I'm impatient and I'm 36.
(2:50:55) " So, yeah, I would also say, you know, a lot of young entrepreneurs when I talk with them. They're like, "Well, you know, my friends are out there and they're making x amount of money doing this or this and it's always a fad." And you know what I tell people is like, do you want a business or do you want to make money? There is a difference.
(2:51:13) You could go, I'm sure, go make more money than this right now with the skills you have. Does that mean that that same thing that you go make money with is going to be around in 12 months? Probably not, because you're just grabbing a fat essentially like everybody else. And so, I think sometimes it feels really disheartening because when you're doing the really hard work that's going to result in achieving your long-term goals, it feels like, well, gosh, but if I did this, it would go faster right now. And so, people pivot because they see that it would be faster now, but it'd be slower later. So, we always like to say harder
(2:51:39) now, easier later. Easier now, harder later. It was actually a lot of what we were talking about with Tom Billio in here is like you want to seek the hard because whatever that hard thing is is the thing that other people are unwilling to do.
(2:51:52) And so like like why do you think Elon's companies are worth so much? Because no one else could be like oh we're just going to create a rocket launching system to put a thousand satellites in space. But if we do that then we could just have internet all over the world. It's like yeah well if you do that then yeah you can just own the internet of the world. And like there was probably more than one hard thing in order to do that.
(2:52:09) Just a few. Yeah. So, okay, that was uh that was 22. Just keep on the path and uh you probably will get there faster than you think. I do think that if you want to if you want from an opening uh strategy perspective, if you want to take over old ice cream parlors, which I think would be my way of doing it because it'll cost you way less from a capital expansion perspective to to open it up.
(2:52:31) Uh because they're already going to have the freezers and all the equipment. And so when I when I expanded the gyms, I think uh two one or two of the gyms were exist. No, two of the gyms that I opened were existing gyms prior and so I was able to just assume them already with the conditional use permits in place, already with a bunch of the equipment in place and so it cost me almost nothing and then I was instantly be able I was able to uh basically recoup my my original investment. Again, not a promise, just like it's just something that helped. Okay, go ahead.
(2:52:58) Uh Civil Productions, Kenny Cox. Okay, so he sells Madden and college football gaming courses. Cool. Okay, $30 a month or $240 a year. uh they have 3,500 base members. Their higher tier is $97 a month and has uh a little more than 20 members and it's failing.
(2:53:22) How should we structure the offer and funnel to drive upgrades to the higher tier? So $30 a month, 3500 members, 97 a month, less than 20 members. So I would have to know more about what the offer is, the high ticket one. Yeah. Um but fun like that's that's super odd because the price discrepancy isn't even like big. It's not even that big of a difference. So, it has to be the offer. Yeah, 100% it's the offer.
(2:53:43) Um, so the the best way that I can describe the difference between like the c the core offer and the upsell is that the core offer should be the thing that they expect to get. The upsell should be the thing they hope they get. And so when someone buys it, they like buy this thing. They're like, man, I hope this thing happens. I hope it's a great day.
(2:54:00) Now, if I were the chief, you know, god of weather, then I'd be like, well, great day is an upsell. Like, I'll make it not rain, you know what I mean? But it's not going to be a great day. You get sun as an upsell. So it's like what is that thing that everyone hopes for? That's what I think about in terms of creating those upsell which is typically going to be a version of some sort of access, some sort of training, some sort of personalization. So this is what I would encourage you to do because I want to give you like actual tactics right now. I would take I would take I
(2:54:24) basically do unscalable services upfront for those people so I could better understand what the problems they really have are. So then I could do more of these types of services, if you will, that are less scalable. and then templatize a solution around that so that we could then make something that is more scalable long term. But you'll actually have spoken to them, you'll speak their language, you'll know what their true pains are.
(2:54:46) And that's probably how I'd approach it. And you might and honestly, if your base is $30 a month, your upsell might be like 300, not 97. So if you think about, again, we think about money models, right? So, if you're at $30 a month, if you want it to be meaningful in terms of the impact for the business, then let's say we get, you know, uh, uh, 20% of people to upsell to the second tier, right? Now, if the second tier is twice the price, right? This is, yours was three times the price, right? Then we get 20% times, you know, 0.2 times 100 bucks. So, $20 added to the average
(2:55:20) ticket of 30. So, that's a 60% increase to the business. Not bad. But like there's probably a 10 or 20 percent that might buy at 300. And then now we've got something that's like significantly more interesting. Super cool. That was good. Thanks. All right. We've got Ali Shaper with super mush gummies. Okay. Mushroom superfood gummies for sex, sleep, and energy.
(2:55:48) All of them at the same time. Hopefully not. Sold D to C, Amazon, and retail. So her question is uh what's your take Alex on Tik Tok shop wave and the shift of e-commerce spend from meta to Tik Tok? I mean I think a lot of people are still spending on meta though to be fair but yeah Tik Tok shop's doing super well I would say um what's my take on it? Yeah like would you allocate more money to Meta to Tik Tok shop? How would you go? So I want to I'll be first and foremost I am platform agnostic like do not care um you know whether it's meta
(2:56:21) YouTube search tabula like whatever like wherever you can get clicks where your avatar is like you care about the customer the platforms are just a vehicle for reaching them so like who cares like all that matters is that you're getting less than it costs you to get them to buy your stuff ideally in 30 days or less. That's good. Okay.
(2:56:45) Uh, we've got Kyle and Ariel Treshk. Okay. Their business is Couple Prreneurs. They sell a 12-month strategic advisory and mastermind for entrepreneurial couples. Currently, they sell a $30,000 offer directly from a free live Zoom master class, and it's working well. Their question is, would a shorter, lowerric version, like 90 days, uh, sold from the masterass create more upfront sales to later upsell into the full program? So, should they do a stair step down? Because currently it's zoomed to 30k.
(2:57:13) I would say it depends on payment terms. So, if you're collecting 30 up front, I would say no, keep doing it. If you're getting if 30 is $2,500 a month, then you'd probably better serve doing a shorter duration and being able to collect more upfront, you'll actually increase your cash conversion cycle.
(2:57:33) Now, the down so like more realistically, what'll happen is so let's say it's 30,000 2500 bucks. What's interesting is that when you sell at a $30,000 price point, people will address the 30,000 and make a decision on that, but then cancel two or three months later because of whatever, right? Whereas, if you say this is 90 days, this is 6 weeks, whatever.
(2:57:54) Um, you can benefit from a much lower ticket and then make the upsell later. So, like I'll I'll I'll show you behind the behind the curtains for me right now. So we have the the 200 book offer, right, which is you donate 200 books, you get all this. And then there's the 800 book offer.
(2:58:11) Okay? And so thinking through this, it was like, okay, I could just say, hey, only do an 800 book offer or I could say only do a 400 book offer. I there's a lot of different permutations here, right? But doing a 200 book offer and then an 800 book offer will increase the likelihood that people, and we have a ton of data on this, by the way. um if someone makes a purchase, which by the way, the reason that the uh pre-order was a $29 VIP was because it would increase the likelihood that people had a card on file. And so by increasing like that they had a card on file, it made the purchasing today much easier
(2:58:37) because you already had it. And so the idea was uh if we can maximize the likelihood that people make an easier purchase at like $6,000 and especially with payment plans and a firm and things like that um then the next purchase which is then the quote continuity that's slightly higher ticket uh would be easier to make.
(2:59:01) And so I I I mean gym launch was a 16k for 16 weeks and then sold year plus. Um, my gyms were 6 weeks more expensive than it would be for that same period of time and then period of time. So, here's what I would encourage you to do. I would try and shorten the front-end thing as much as you possibly can. And I'll explain why. It actually will make it more attractive because all your like duration is not a selling point. Like really think about this.
(2:59:25) Duration is not a selling point. If I told you that I could pull your tooth out in an hour, I can do it in 60 seconds. You'd rather the 60 seconds. And so if I can fix your marriage for entrepreneurs or you know your main thing if I can do that in two weeks then it gets into believability.
(2:59:44) So it's really we want the absolute shortest time possible that someone believes that you could deliver the service and so maybe that's six weeks maybe that's eight weeks but at that point then you're selling the solution and you might be able to charge half a third of what you were charging for the 30. So maybe you can get away with, you know, 10 or 12,000 for that for that much shorter period and then you'll be able to pull cash flow forward, get way more prepaids paid in fulls where with the 30 you're probably not getting that.
(3:00:08) And so if all of a sudden you can collect eight or 10 or 12 up front per person rather than 2500, which is what you're getting with 30 and then the cancel and the average LTV is like 8 grand. Here you're actually making more and then you still get the second bite of the apple even if 30% or 40% are only the ones who are going to renew. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more how I'd answer it.
(3:00:26) It's a fantastic answer. Thank you, Ila. I appreciate that. I get to live with this, too. Encyclopedia, you know, nothing like after a long day, I come home and I'm like, tell me what the upsell is. Okay, I got one last question for you and then I'll have the team give us a final count. So, we have Ryan Rice. His business is by RIC.
(3:00:48) We buy and flip houses selling directly to other investors. Revenue depends on acquisition and resale timing. Paid marketing usually takes 90 plus days to pay back. His question is for businesses built on buying and reselling out assets like house flipping. What's the best money model beyond just shortening the buy to sell cycle? Should we consider an education play like many large flippers? Well, honestly, when I when it's a really good question.
(3:01:22) So when I when I think about businesses like this, I I don't think that on my first try with no have no additional context to the business, I'm going to get it better than someone who's done it for a very long time. So my next like my first look would then be like, okay, we buy ugly houses. They do they have some sort of real estate business because I see their stuff everywhere and they're national.
(3:01:41) So I would look at the biggest players and be like, what is their business model? What is their money model? And I would see is there any element of what they're currently doing that I can do in a different or better way in modern day media because one of the big things is some of these old companies get the advantage of infrastructure and brand but what they don't have is the advantage of innovation, agility and kind of creativity that a smaller brand can have. And so you can always beat them in the edges or you can always beat them in the in the tactical stuff
(3:02:06) because you're not competing against that founder anymore. That guy's 80. He already sold whatever, right? you're try you're basically competing against account rep number six who got hired four years out of college and is doing some quote marketing for this company. So it's it's a lot easier to beat big business than you think it is unless they have incredible network effects that make it impossible which is a separate you know separate discussion but they don't.
(3:02:29) So yeah they're beatable those companies are mostly marketing companies. Yeah. Thanks for answering those questions. Oh you're welcome. Team I I know that the the screen is stuck because I know it's uh higher than that. How many copies have we sold? Can someone give me the live count? Is it? It seems like it's fine. Mm- Oh, nice. All right, great.
(3:02:49) Anybody? Buler, it looks like it's updating. Nope, it's behind. Okay, I I trust you. I believe you. Do you want to put my shoe on and see what it feels like? 2.5 million. Yeah, there we go. We're there. Yeah, it's accurate. Sweet. All right. Am I uh So, we closing uh we we closing this down. As a reminder, when we close it down, the live uh live launch bonus goes away.
(3:03:18) So, how about you chug it and we we close it down once you check. Well, let me see. Anybody else checking out? Because I I'll I'll answer a couple questions if somebody's checking out needs to get it. All right. We good? Chug it. Okay. You want She's like, "Chug it. Chug it." All right. You didn't drink any water. Just beer. I want to see Alex the legend Horoszi come out. Oh god.
(3:03:42) What does that mean? You guys know in college Alex was quite the legend. I got to I got to hear about that. Okay. So you guys are awesome. Um if you have a normalsized beer, I'll shotgun it. But photo op. Let's do a photo op. All the green guys in What are we doing? I don't know. I'll have my beer here. Thank you guys. All right.
(3:04:14) And uh I will chug this for y'all. You guys rock. The record has been completely obliterated. Yeah. So the So guys, the record was 1.43 and I like really wanted to break it. So I kind of like pulled out all the stops and it looks like we uh we broke it by like a million. Um so that's chill.
(3:04:33) And we still have we still have like I don't know like 20 or 18 hours something like that to to keep going. So yeah, we're gonna keep raging. Um as a reminder, if you are on the fence right now, the live launch bonus is going to go away, which now is the Guinness World Record launch bon. Oh, hey. Uh which is now the Guinness World Record launch, which is, you know, great. Pretty pretty badass, I think.
(3:04:56) Now, that being said, uh you guys were awesome. I can't I can't even begin to tell you how much work went into this stuff. Like a lot like a lot. Like a lot of work. Um like so much work. Uh so are we holding this now? We're doing more photos. Keep doing we're going to do photos. Well, you guys are great. Thank you guys for being champs.
(3:05:19) We're uh I guess you only have I'll put the beer down because I'm sure Leila will be upset that there's a beer in it. There you go. I'm so upset. Got it. All right. Great. Thank you guys. So before before we before we before we before we before we Yeah. So again, live stream ends. That bonus goes away.
(3:05:39) That's the Guinness World Record, you know, launch, you know, collateral. Um I want to say special thanks to everyone that is not on this screen right now. Um there is so much that went into into making this happen. We have redundancies.
(3:05:56) Like I don't know what's happened behind the scenes, but we have three redundancies for Wi-Fi to make sure that the live stream would keep going. We have two redundancies for power outside of the three redund. We have two generators and a battery pack in addition to the power that's going to the to the actual all the screens, all the all the stuff that's powering the cameras.
(3:06:15) Um we had we we hired and trained 300 phone reps uh to help anybody who needed to check out check out. Uh we have 90 support reps who are handling support right now and full-time. Uh we also uh have 30 of my internal team that are not actively like manning stuff that are on the phones also helping out.
(3:06:34) So I guess it's 330 plus that are just helping people check out if they have issues. Um beyond that we have Go ahead. You want to say more? No, I I can talk though. Yeah, go for it. Oh, okay. No, I was just going to say like I think for everybody watching like you're all here inspired by what you've seen today and what Alex has presented to you and what we've just presented to you guys, but like I want you guys to know like you can't do it without a team.
(3:06:56) Like this doesn't happen without so many people so dedicated and we're just really lucky that we have an amazing team that was willing to wear green suits for the last month. Um you know, drink energy drinks and um be here every day and we couldn't have done it without them.
(3:07:16) No, like a special thanks to uh to Maggie for uh for for just managing a ton of stuff and putting al all together. I shouldn't have probably said names now to say everybody. Um so I will so everybody else I I'm not going to say that. So Maggie, you just got a a special shout out. Um special thanks to Trevor for for all all book related activities. Um you know who you are.
(3:07:35) Uh beyond that honestly just thanks to you guys. Um, like thank you guys for being here since since 2021, making little YouTube videos. Um, couldn't have done it without you. Uh, I can say with a lot of earnestness that, uh, we are not going to stop. So, we're going to keep going. We're going to keep making stuff.
(3:07:53) We're going to keep doing the best we can and we will we will mess up. Um, but we will do our absolute best. I also want to say thank you for donating so many books. U, there's a ton of entrepreneurs. The amount of story like I can't even I it it borders.
(3:08:11) So, the reason you guys might have noticed that like there's not a single income claim um in this presentation um which would be very easy to make with a book called Money Models. The reason that there is no income claim is just for FTC stuff. Um but the amount of messages and and videos and long letters of like my business went from X to Y and Z to W and I can, you know, my I could feed my family now.
(3:08:30) we moved into a new neighborhood because we can afford it and we finally bought our first home or like I bought the building my business is in or I finally quit my job and I started my own thing and now I'm doing I'm doing tour advisor stuff or I I learned how to do you know rank and rent and now all of a sudden I've got 10 clients paying me $2,000 a month everything's changed right like you guys are the reason we do this um and these goals are motivating for us but at the same time like just putting more books in the in the hands of entrepreneurs
(3:08:55) that's why I take the time to write these books um because my life was changed through those and so I just try and model the things that changed my life. Thank you guys. Yeah, thank you guys so much. And uh I guess we'll I'll I'll kill this. How long How long is everything going to be up? How long is everything going to be up? Okay, so here's your Are we saying it? We saying it. Oh, I don't know. I'm just rolling. I wasn't even gonna be up here.
(3:09:24) Okay, we're just rolling. Yeah, we are beyond our We've stayed beyond our our welcome here. Um this this will end. I will say that this will end very soon. Um and if you want to make a decision, you should do so now. And that launch bonus which like got this certificate that has literally never been done by any any human in the non-fiction space.
(3:09:51) As also a side note, we also crossed the number five, which is Yeah, I don't want to say anything, but uh we also Yeah. crossed the non-fiction. Yeah. So, we're we're number five in all time of all books ever. of all books ever as of right now. Um which just crossed non-fiction. Yeah. As a non-fiction book. Old us over here.
(3:10:14) So, I'll tell you I'll give you guys a hint. The number one through five is all owned by the same person. the absolute goat. So, I have no I have no I have no goal to beat the goat. Harry Potter. It's Harry Potter. And so, which I love. Yeah, we're huge fans. Um and so we just crossed uh Cursed Child uh the script uh which she released I think has two million. It sold 2 million copies in the first 24 hours. You're a wizard. Yeah.
(3:10:44) And so, um, right now, the only books that are ahead this book, we still have, you know, 18 hours left. Uh, the only books that are ahead this book are Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, um, what's the sixth one? Why am I losing my Oh, Order of the Phoenix. Half Blood Prince. Half Blood Prince. Oh, Half Blood Prince. Yeah. And then, uh, and then the Deathly Hallows.
(3:11:03) So good. And so those are the those are the only four books in history that have sold more books than this book in the first 24 hours. Maybe she'll want to have coffee. She what? I'd like to meet her. Yeah, I would love to JK. I'll have I'll have a beer with JK. A butter beer. A butter beer if you will. A butterbeer. Yeah, maybe a jelly beer.
(3:11:23) The every berry bots every flavored beans. I'd have them all. Um anyhoos uh so anyways, that just happened. So that's kind of cool. Uh but anyways, this this launch bonus which created this, all the marketing behind this, all of the internal memos, all of the strategy that created this, um it goes away uh as soon as we turn this off, which is happening momentarily. So like grab it if you want it.
(3:11:47) Um what's nice is that the launch one is digital, so you can you can use it to uh to train AI to help retrofit some of those so some of those assets for your own business. Um, yeah. And the the school group's already popping off. Oh, is it? Oh, fantastic. Great. So, also for the the ultra ballers, the super business owners, uh the 800 uh book thank you page um offer.
(3:12:15) Uh you just make the first payment today and then you're in. And so I just because again it's like I don't have unlimited phone people and I'm sure they're I'm sure I don't know, but I'm sure they're hammered and it's it's probably a a blood blood bath. It's actually going great. Oh, is it great? Well, you know, we prepared for a long time. We did a lot of training.
(3:12:32) We uh took it in house and look, nothing broke. I know. I know. So, I know you guys know, but last year the internet last time the internet broke and so um hope you guys are cool just like going a little behind the scenes just hanging out. Is that all right with you guys? Is that cool? Give me a little behind the scenes. Okay. Um what? Ask them for the our our gum. Your gum and my gum. Well, my gum spilled. Oh, I had a beer.
(3:12:50) I guess I'll hold this for now. Um Okay. I'm going to put this away because it's already over here. This is great. Okay. Fantastic. Yeah, we break the record. Yay, it happened. And now, you know what that means? That emptiness that you feel inside of you. Now, it's the next milestone. It was a good three minutes. Um, glad we spent three years, you know, two years building to that moment.
(3:13:09) Um, but first off, thank you to all the Australians and the New Zealanders who I know have stayed up for like like an absurd amount of time to do this launch. Uh, you guys are awesome. The the least I could do is drink a beer out of my shoe um which is just soaked in sweat. like literally soaked in sweat.
(3:13:27) I can like my shoes are squishy anyways from how uh how wet they are. Um but beyond that, what are you getting? Gum. Is that the gum? Not really. Oh, nicotine gum. I'll throw that. Yeah, I want Yeah, I'm not going to go natty gum. What do you think? I am a savage. But um anyways, the uh the the thought process behind this was I knew some of you guys wanted to have I wanted to have have a school community for some of the business owners. I wanted to have a little bit of a gate. And so if you donate more books, you can join it. It's on the thank you page. Um but obviously
(3:13:57) it's for the super business owners. Um and so we put it there. But that being said, all of the all these raw materials are for everybody. Um if you donate 200 books, we'll be giving them away and you have a whole year to use them.
(3:14:14) All right? So if you again, it's like if you want to use these to incentivize people to join a community, if you want to use them to train your employees, the number one request we had from last year was like, can you just give me a code because I don't want to have to deal with holding the books. And so there was a there's two big decisions that we had to make when we were were making this that were kind of like oneway doors.
(3:14:26) One of them was international. Uh one of the big downsides of international is like either you have to pay a lot for shipping or we just say we don't sell to your country. Those are literally the only two options. And both of them huh we don't control shipping. Yeah. We don't control shipping. And so it's like you hate me either way.
(3:14:44) And so I just figured that you know at least giving the option to people who wanted to buy and were willing to spend whatever the extra in shipping is was better than just not having the option. So, that was the decision there. Um, the other decision was I can't remember. Probably the beers went straight to the head. Who knows? No, it's fine. Maybe the green guys. You want to come out? Yeah. Special.
(3:15:02) Yeah. To the $und00 million men. So, what you guys don't know is that like you guys probably saw a little bit of content the last week or two that came from the $und00 million men. So, kuda, you know, give them a little shout. Um, the uh guys, come on. They're coming. Come on out. Yeah. Yeah. Take a bow. Take a bow. We only have one. We have only one $100 million man.
(3:15:21) Everybody else is like manning phones and stuff. I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So, all right. Well, you know, you as a representative of the whole the whole all of them. Thank you. We all Thank you. There was lots the whole So, there was a bunch of them, but beyond that, um the only reason they they took that over so they could give me the space to keep working on this presentation, training team, making like bigger decisions uh around this launch to make sure that it could actually happen. Um, and so they actually like all those all those posts like they they literally just I didn't even I didn't
(3:15:52) sell for any of that. They just 100% did it themselves. And so that's like a special kudos to them for just being awesome. Yeah. Special kudos to them. Special kudos to Shiron. Yeah. Son Dog, you want to you want to come out? S Dog Millionaire. Knew you back there. Oh man. Yeah.
(3:16:16) Hey, so we did it. Couldn't have done it. Yeah. Couldn't it without you? Yeah. Do you want to drink a beer out of my show? Um, no. No. I'll drink a beer out of whatever you want. Jesus. I'm a lady. My whole team watching. What am I supposed to say? Well, I wasn't going to break that silence. I was just going to let you break that one later.
(3:16:49) Anyways, um, yeah, do you wanna do you want to give a little bit of context in terms of like so Leila basically took over a huge amount of the responsibilities that I have inside of ACQ almost for like the last like nine months so that I could put all this stuff together like it was a lot. Um, I mean you started working on this. Yeah. I want to say the first conversations about this launch were two years ago. Yeah. No.
(3:17:13) Um, and you know, I think as businesses grow, you kind of have to figure out at some point. I think we used to overlap a lot more and then at some point you have to kind of decide like where are you going to spend your time and I think we said, you know, you writing these materials, putting these things together. Um, it's the highest leverage thing that you can do to help everybody.
(3:17:31) And so that's kind of how I think we split it. like probably two years ago we made that decision is like that's you creating things like that me being the the person handling the business side like that that's how we can do it you know. Yeah.
(3:17:48) Yeah. I was even including all the all the one day consult I was even including that which definitely has happened this whole time. Yeah. So I think um you know just in general it's a lot of you know I think it's a season though you know and I think for everyone that's you know asks and you talk about the sacrifice you make you made so much sacrifice in terms of time in terms of sleep health our marriage.
(3:18:16) No, but you know what I tell everybody is like it's a decision and me and Alex talk and we have seasons where we get to be really close and it's comfortable and things are a lot more chill and then we have seasons where we say we're going to gas it and it was definitely a season that I think we gas the last 18 months I want to say. Um and the the next season will not be as much gas for a minute because you got to recuperate and you got to restore yourself. Um, but we did it because we wanted to do something epic.
(3:18:42) And I think that the thing that we always default to and um is like what's going to make the best story. And I remember it's funny because when you were going about to go up here, I just remembered I don't know if you remember this when we were in Arizona doing our launch in Phoenix. Yeah.
(3:19:04) I remember in the extended stay and we were in the parking lot of Walmart and I remember we were walking and we were like we had $1,000 and we're like what are we doing wrong? And I remember sucks so Yeah. And I remember us walking in the parking lot to go into the Walmart and we were like looking up at the sky and I was like I swear like I just remember I I just thought to myself I was like if we just keep going it's going to make it all worth it and like we're going to get there one day. Yeah. And I saw you like going up here.
(3:19:33) It's like it's so funny because you know you see the numbers and the records and all that but it's like damn like that was 10 years ago you know. Yeah, 10 years we were in the extended stay had $1,000 and you know like the reason that this stuff is important to us is because you know I think people see success and fame and money and they're like oh you must not like I have never not felt like I I probably still feel very much insecure and like like that person in many ways. Now I don't doesn't mean that completely
(3:20:03) but I still very much think about that and think about gosh it's so cool to come this far. It's so cool to have a team that can help put this together. It's so cool to have such an impact. And so for all of you watching and thinking like, gosh, I hope one like you can one day. Like you can do the same one day.
(3:20:20) And I hope somebody that's watching this, I hope you break the record next because this now it's like the four-minute mile. Like the four-minute mile for books has been run, right? Like now we are number one in non-fiction, but like who's next? It can be one of you. And like it doesn't have to take as long as you think it does.
(3:20:38) And I think if there's anything about our journey that I hope inspires you guys today, yes, there's the business and the money, all this, but it's like just what's possible. And there's nothing different about either of us than there is of you. 10 years ago, we were in the the audience. We would have been in the audience with all of you.
(3:20:54) And it's just the reps. It's the work. And it's literally just not quitting, you know? And I think we're lucky because we have each other. So anytime one of us feels down, we pull the other up. You know, if you're in a partnership, you got to do that. Like when one is down, you pull the other up.
(3:21:13) But just like anything is possible if you just don't quit and you just got to give yourself that shot. It's like I always tell myself I'm like you got to make it worth it. Like if you're in pain right now and you're listening to this and you've watched this and you're like gosh I want to be where like we were in deep pain 10 years ago and and it's still painful. Don't get me wrong. Business is not easy and achieving goals and doing things that are challenging is not easy but man like make it worth it.
(3:21:32) You know that's like what I think to myself. Like I'm having a really freaking bad day. I'm like, if you stop now, it's not the pain will have been worth nothing. You got to keep going to make it worth it to find what's on the other side. And I think a lot of this, that's what I think about like this morning going into this launch and while I'm behind the scenes like watching, I'm just like, man, I remember, you know, that night in the parking lot and then going into that Walmart saying, "It looks like all the
(3:21:56) other Walmarts in the country. This extended stay looks like all the other extended stays." and thinking like, you know, I mean, I really like thinking about you and how much I believed in you and I was like, we're going to we're going to get out of this. It's not going to be the same. I was like, we can do this. This guy's going to make more than $1,000. I know it.
(3:22:15) Penny stocks, baby. Penny stocks. Penny stocks. No, I mean, like, so I just I feel for everybody that's watching this right now and is just feeling the pain because there's so much uncertainty. There's so much. And like at the end of the day, the reason I like making content, I like doing things like this is I don't want people to have to go through the same pain.
(3:22:33) If you're going through pain right now, the whole point of this, I don't want everyone to go through the same pain, you know? No, I want to save a little bit of it, you know, but like a little, you know, a little bit. I'm too nurturing. I default to protecting. Uh that's where we differ. Like if we can just save you a little bit of the pain.
(3:22:50) 10% 10% less 20%. Eight 8% less pain. What kind of people do they want to become? You know, I do that too. No. Um, thank you guys. Yeah. Thank you guys so much. Um and thank you like thank you from me and thank you from the 2.5 million entrepreneurs who are going to get well minus however many books get you know redeemed directly.
(3:23:21) Um thank you from all the other entrepreneurs who are going to get this. This is um is I mean it's beyond what I expected. So um thank you again so much. We're I mean we're going to do everything in our power to uphold that and um continue to just give more stuff and continue to reinvest in educating entrepreneurs and writing more books. Oh god, more books. Uh I wrote a lot of books lately. This was two years of my life. Um um but it was for you guys.
(3:23:47) Record. Yeah. To the next record. Yeah. May it let uh maybe it'll be one of you guys. Yeah. Hopefully it is. And use all the stuff in the books. Seriously, take action with it. All right. So, the the marketer in me wouldn't let me uh wouldn't let me end this without doing this. So, you wanna I mean, you're welcome to stay if you want. All right. So, one last time as I close this out.
(3:24:12) I I can't I can't I don't think I could do it. I think I could do it without doing it. Um so, one last time for anyone. Uh so, the live stream is going to end. So, if you've been on the fence, do it now. So, go to go.acq.com, go check out. Um there is shipping for international.
(3:24:31) And if this was $7,000, you probably would be fine with it, too. So, just change your mind about how you think about the price. Um anyways the you donate 200 books to other entrepreneurs and when you do that you get the last two years of my life basically uh consolidated into the most checklist format I can possibly give. And so each one of these I tried to always take the perspective of what will this change about their behavior? What actions will they take as a result of reading this book or this playbook so that they can have an increased
(3:25:01) likelihood of getting this outcome. How can I increase the likelihood that their ads will continue to scale and do so profitably? These are the behaviors that we took in order to increase that to happen in the highest percentage of businesses. That is what's contained in goed ads. All right? Like you saw in there, people weren't like, "Oh, it took me years to read these things.
(3:25:18) " So many of them were like, "I read it in one sitting. I did it. It worked. I'm not promising it's going to work for you. Your results will be different." Right? Everyone's a a special snowflake. All right? But these have the most consolidated ways that I've had to consolidate.
(3:25:36) How do I just get someone to have ads that are profitable? That's what's included in the go to ads playbook, which is the first thing you get for free inside of the hooks playbook. Like, man, content was tough for me. As much as like people were like, "Oh, it took off overnight." It's like, well, I mean, I started making content in 20120, so besides that. Yeah, overnight. U no, that's not true. Sorry. 2017. Gez, 2017 is when I started making content.
(3:25:52) And so, it took me a very long time to figure this out. And I don't think I have like the natural, you know, I have content from like 20 2013, 2012. and I didn't have like I needed that um to see how bad I was. And so it's just taking me a lot of reps.
(3:26:11) And so this basically is like here's my best of here's the like here's the slivers of like if I only had 20 minutes, an hour, an hour and a half to just be like this is everything you need to know. This is what this is. So that's the hooks playbook. All right. And you get that free when you donate 200 bucks. Now, on top of donating that and getting it for free, you'll also get the branding playbook, which I suspect for many of you might be the one that unlocks what you need. And I kept it simple. It's not it's not this big amorphous topic.
(3:26:33) It's like associate this with this. Here's how you broaden it. Here's how you narrow it. Here's how you pivot it. Because many of you in different positions, some of you are like, "Hey, I want to go from car sales to sales." Some of you guys are in a position you're like, you know what? I want to go to general business or, you know, I was in general business, but I think I need to niche down.
(3:26:50) This will show you how to make the directional change within your brand to actually get what you want in terms of the associations that will drive sales, command premium prices, and ultimately get cheaper leads. And in a world where no one trusts anyone, brand is going to be the mode. I'm telling you guys right now, like this be calling it, right? Brand is going to be the mode.
(3:27:08) And the difference between small business owners and big business owners is their understanding of branding. So that's the third. We're only three playbooks in. You get all those for free. All right. with the 200 bucks. Now, the marketing machine, and I didn't actually really get a chance because I had to like keep up the the momentum of doing this, but since we're all hanging out, let's hang out. Um, the marketing machine.
(3:27:27) So, this is what enabled me to sell Gym Launch. Like, I wasn't I wouldn't have been able to sell Gym Launch had I not had this. And I had to figure this out because basically, we had to take the perspective of like, okay, if we are going to sell it, they won't let us be like, I can't be the face of this thing if there somebody else is gonna be the owner, right? And so I then had to ask the question like, how can I generate as many leads, as many sales with nothing I already do? And so it turns out when I was looking through this, when I was trying to figure this out for myself, that there's basically nine different places in a
(3:27:57) business that occur within the normal course of business that if you just set up these one-time setups, you can create these endless flows of creative. So think about this like as an internal UGC system.
(3:28:15) So obviously many people have heard of UGC user generated content like how do you create an affiliate network that creates content like that's what Tik Tok shops all about and that's super valuable don't get me wrong but like you do business every day and so if there's a way that you can control it without the outreach without the management of groups and all the other stuff that goes into that. If you could just have a machine that you install once and then every week you get delivered fresh creative from what you already do and this is something that can work for businesses that are in person right for brickandmortar for services. Obviously,
(3:28:39) UGC works great for, you know, physical products that are e-commerce and things like that, but many other businesses that are service based like that's like a lot, you know, a lot of people aren't like, "Oh my god, I'm going to make this this great UGC video about my lawn getting cut.
(3:28:52) " Not it's not happen as much, right? And so having the internal flows to create the advertising you need to scale the business. This system, this playbook shows you exactly how I did it and how you can do it, too. And it works for any business. All right, so you get all four of those free uh when you donate 200 bucks. Beyond that, I just putting gum.
(3:29:12) Hold on. Let me I'll take my gum off there. Oh, there you go. Okay. On top of that, um, lead nurture. So, I I I I don't want to feel I don't want I don't want to be self arandizing here. I would say if I this is ridiculous to say, lead nurture is one of my core skills. Um, both from a long-term branding perspective, but even from the short-term perspective, how do we maximize the likelihood that someone shows? And so Allen, which was a mistake for me to do from a business perspective long term, I bought Allen, not bought, I founded Allen, uh, which
(3:29:42) was a company that only did automated lead nurture. So that's where it started, automated lead nurture something. I don't even remember what it was stood for. Uh, Allen. And so anyways, uh, when I when I when I when I founded Allen and we built it, I got this great machine scientist, um, which is what, you know, the the precursors of AI, right? um he's a big site a big big big data guy and he came in he won the like the Google Olympics for machine learning in Russia barely spoke English but the guy knew what he was doing and so I said I need you to do independent variable analysis and he had we had
(3:30:14) 1,200 different variables that we kept inside of the system to figure out what increased the likelihood of shows and by by analyzing all 1200 um we were able to isolate basically the core activities that must be taken by the software andor a person to maximize the likelihood that someone schedules and shows.
(3:30:32) And by isolating those things, we're able to turn them into behaviors that someone could follow. Um, and that's what this is about. And so that's what this entire lead nurture playbook is. Like I I'm so bullish on lead nurture. Like I told you about uh IBC, the insurance company, earlier.
(3:30:51) Like if you're somebody who has less than 70% show rates, it is fixable with process. That's why this one is so powerful. Like there's so few things that you can just say like oh you can go from 50 to this is not a promise that's going to happen for you. That's not my point here. I'm just saying hypothetically speaking if you go from 40 to 80% simple math for me it's a double. That's doable.
(3:31:11) Getting doubling your close rate not not always doable, right? Like if you're at 35% like you're probably not going to go to 70% close rates unless you dramatically change your offer or price. But like you can double your show rates and you can for sure get a 20% 30% 50% lift in show rates. I'm not saying that's gonna happen for you. I'm just saying it can happen.
(3:31:33) And so I have like I'm super bullish on this lead nurture playbook. Like you can like I told you I almost started a fund on just trying to find businesses that had bad nurture and just getting doubles and triples from that. Thank you for this cookie. Appreciate that. I'm guessing people think that I have low blood sugar. We'll find out. So that's the first of the sales system. This is all free.
(3:31:51) On top of that, you have the closing playbook. Um, I could talk about sales, but um, I just want to talk about the sexiest thing that's inside of here, which is the seven universal closes. So, I've spent a very long time um, studying sales, right? And what's been really interesting about my my study of sales is that I have a a more simplistic view of it now than I did at the beginning.
(3:32:13) And maybe it's the Midwit meme, right? In the beginning it was like just you know just ask people what they want see if you can do it and then and then solve the problem right ask them to buy and then in the middle it's like tonality and shifts and pacing and cadence and blah blah blah and NLP and all these other things right in the end it's just like hey just be clear speak loudly like ask them multiple times and find a way to ask them in such a way that doesn't offend them right and so having the universal closes is
(3:32:37) something that's so important because you can teach them you can you can memorize all right? Very easily. And this has now become I'm changing how we're even doing sales stuff with this um because of this this big aha and you will be able to ask more times without having the person have to go through a decision tree.
(3:33:02) And so if you're really good at sales like some maybe some of you guys are founder led you're like man I close at 80% but my team closes at 30. Right? It's because you sell with a consultative frame, right? And I can sell with a consultative frame because I'm an expert at these things. And so as soon as someone perceives you as an expert, then you gain you gain status, you gain leverage, and you gain influence, right? But you have to create a sales system or a sales script that allows someone who doesn't have that influence, doesn't have that leverage, and can still close deals. That's what
(3:33:26) this will help you build. So that's the closing playbook. That's the second playbook inside of the sales system. The proof checklist, man, this thing's a monster. What's really cool about proof is that I it was basically a deep dive that I did on proof to try and figure out like, okay, what makes a piece of proof not compelling versus another piece of proof that's very compelling. Like there was a reason I asked everyone on the screens to hold up their hands in real time. And I did that because it was
(3:33:52) real time. It was not, you know, fakeable. Like I somebody could have held up a one or a two or who knows, right? And so see, they're real people. There we go. Right. We got some we got some hands, right? And so, how do I demonstrate proof in as many different ways and at the right times to increase the likelihood that someone is going to make a purchasing decision? And so, this proof checklist is like so good. So good.
(3:34:16) And you can set it up once inside of the business and benefit from it. And so, you'll get the lead system which includes all four playbooks free. You'll get the sales system which includes all four playbooks free. When you donate 200 bucks, just donate some to other entrepreneurs. All right? That's my ask. Now, the delivery system. So, lifetime value.
(3:34:34) I I didn't expect that cuz honestly, like I spent a lot of my time prepping for the first half of today. Um, and like making sure school was ready for the volume and all the other things that went into today. Um, all the conversations that I had with friends of mine uh was completely basically completely uncanned. I just had like what money model we're going to go over and that's pretty much all I prepared.
(3:34:53) Um, but beyond that, lifetime value is probably you notice that was a big theme. And so in some ways the better you get at marketing the more I see acquiring customers to be almost a commodity right like once you learn how to advertise you learn how to sell you learn you learn these core components right the thing that differentiates one business from another is their ability to increase lifetime value and the nice thing is that there are repeatable frameworks that I had to learn across different industries that I could put in one place so that I mean honestly I write this stuff down so I don't have to
(3:35:23) remember it right I write these I write these artifacts down So I can be like, "Okay, team, this is how I train you, right? This is we need to apply this to that business so that I don't have to repeat myself over and over and over again." But this has the checklist of like, "Okay, we have a business.
(3:35:34) It's profit. You know, it's it's it's making some money. It's got some acquisition system, but if we could just double LTV, it would change everything for this business. We'd be able to 5x the amount that we can spend on advertising." And so I'll tell you a story. So, one of the companies that we have in the portfolio, um, they were doing gosh, I think they had done gosh, I think they had done two-ish million the year before and then they shot out of a gun and then they were doing, call it, I don't know, 10ish
(3:36:06) million. Now, at that point, we figured out a way to increase LTV of the customer and we more or less doubled it. But what's crazy is that that doubling resulted in that business in I think 24 36 months. Let's just say 36 so I'm not overpromising here. Um resulted in nine figures in sales in a year.
(3:36:27) It was 100 I think it was 120 million 36 months later because what happened was was because we're able to unlock LTV we could outspend everyone. And so basically there's two big mega ways to create a monopoly. Okay. So way one is that your cost of acquiring customer is lower than everyone else is. It's zero. This is the whole viral quotient idea.
(3:36:46) This is what social media platforms are built on. This is how school works, right? Well, school works, we have both, but like I want to get into that. Okay, so there's how can we get customers for as little as humanly possible. On the other extreme, it's how can we make more from customers than anyone else possibly can and as a result be able to outspend our competition to acquire.
(3:37:05) So one of them is like we're not going to play the same game. We're just going to get customers for very cheap. The other is how do we spend as much as humanly possible? And so by doing that, basically this playbook will show you the frameworks that I think through when we're trying to fix this within a business so we can increase LTV.
(3:37:23) Now in a very tactical level, like I could have probably just left it at that, but some of you just have pure churn issues. Like it's very tactical like I just need churn to go down. And so with school, you know, and and obviously being friends with PC and seeing all the all the numbers that he has access to, um we have a tremendous amount of data that we sit on.
(3:37:40) And so putting together the churn uh churn playbook. Sorry, this I keep messing this up because I used to call this the churn checklist because it sounded so sexy. Um but I was like, you know what, I should I should name it as a benefit. So it's retention. Maybe I should have called it the churn checklist.
(3:37:58) Anyways, so inside of here you'll you'll you'll get the basically the churn elimination protocol, the things that we do to reduce churn reliably um across service businesses and obviously software because that's where you know that's where you come from. All right. All right. So, if you have a recurring or some sort of subscription related business, like if all this does is just decrease the churn that you have, this thing is just going to like it'll be worth it for you.
(3:38:15) Again, not a promise that's going to happen for you. Your results will vary. All right? But just just it's great. Now, beyond that, so you're going to get the lead system free. You'll get the sales system free. You'll get the delivery system free. But on top of that, you'll get the profit system.
(3:38:28) Now, fast cash. Now, I'll give you a little bit more context. The reason that this worked so well for like the reason this was a pivotal like gym launch wouldn't have been gym launch without fast cash this play. All right. So the reason we were able to charge and we still are right able to charge 16 32 36 and I think you know 4041,458 right per year in a space where people make less than that. Think about that. Their their median income in the gym space is around $30ish,000 a year.
(3:38:57) All right it's right around there. We're charging more than 100% of people's income. So, how is that possible? We had to make people sorry, we had to we had to find a way or give them the skills to monetize in order to get the help they needed. And that's exactly what this is.
(3:39:17) And so, if you are B2B especially now, there's two use cases for this. Use case one is if you're B2B, this is this is one that has a huge amount of leverage. Let me explain why. So if you help dentists, you help any kind of business in a specific way, especially around lead generation and marketing, if you can give them a play where they can immediately reactivate, they can use their existing base in order to generate more sales and this will show you how to generate the uh the scarcity, how to price it, how many to limit it by like the playbook that like we have test like we have done this a lot of times. Um and
(3:39:47) this will show you what we do to generate uh cash flow for customers quickly. What this does is it allows you to charge more upfront, give you more prepayment discounts that you can give to a customer so that you can accelerate cash flow conversion within the business. I told you this is the money model's implementation.
(3:40:05) The whole point of a money model is to get more customers, spend more money, less time over and over again, right? This is one of the ways that we do that. We accelerate cash flow in the business. And so that's what uh fast cash does. Now, if you're doing it intelligently, then you want to say, "Hey, if I can run this play once, like what stops me from running it multiple times?" Which is a great way to think. And so this will give you the cash calendar that shows you how to do this over and over again throughout the year.
(3:40:24) And what's crazy about this is that I used to talk to gym owners and so what would happen is they would they would run the fast cash play. They would be able to pay us pretty quickly, right? But then after that they just wouldn't do it again.
(3:40:41) And so it's really interesting about business owners, entrepreneurs, whatever you want to say, just humans, is that we are so willing to work for someone else but not ourselves. So think about that for a second. So like if you're an entrepreneur, you probably had to scramble to pay taxes, scramble to make payroll, scramble to make rent. And who are you paying there? You're paying your employees, you're paying your landlord, you're paying the government.
(3:41:00) But whenever it's like, why aren't we scrambling to pay ourselves? Like why are we not why are we not approaching our business from that perspective of like, well, there's no reason not to make a killing in May. May is a great month, just as good a month as any. And so this is why having a calendar, a cadence to run these plays.
(3:41:18) And what's I remember I'll tell you the first one of these I ever ran in my whole life. So there was this uh so Sam I told you the story, right? Sam's my first first guy I I paid to help me with start a gym when I didn't have one. And so what Sam did was he told me um he said, "Hey, you should run this thing called Big Booty." So Big Booty Boot Camp. All right.
(3:41:38) And so mind you, I'm 22. I'm a guy. I have like an 80% female gym. And he says, "Run Big Booty Boot Camp." So I'm sitting there, I'm like, "Okay." Uh, and so I I He says, "Here, here are the emails. Go send them." And so I send the emails out, and this is the first couple months of the gym. Like I wasn't making a lot of money. And I send them out.
(3:41:58) And I think I signed up, don't quote me on the numbers, just me just estimating. All right. I think I I think I signed up something like 40 or 50 people at 300 bucks each. I think it was I remember it was like $9,000. That sounds about right. So I Yeah. So it's 15 people, two sessions, uh uh $300 each. I think that's what it was. And so I ended up making $9,000, which for me was like absurd.
(3:42:22) This is not a promise that's going to happen for you. I'm going be clear here. All right. But I saw that and I was like, "Holy cow." But was crazy is that that extra revenue drops straight to the bottom line. And I was like, "Whoa." Because when I thought about, okay, so the average gym owner takes home on 12.5% net income.
(3:42:40) Okay, that's what the industry average are, depending on what report you're looking at. So if and the average gym does around $350,000 a year. So if you're looking at 12.5% on, let's just call it 300 grand to make it simple. 36ish,000 a year is what they're taking home. So for me, just imagine this. I make $9,000. I was like, this is a quarter of my annual income. This is absurd from a couple emails.
(3:43:02) I was like, I should do this more. And this created this quarterly system for me to to to generate more cash and serve my customers in a new and exciting way. And so this works from a B2B perspective so that you can help these businesses make more.
(3:43:19) And on a B toC perspective, if you are the type of business that sells to consumers, then instead of having an agency or a marketing consultant or whatever telling you, hey, run this play, just run it yourself. And so that's what the fast cash playbook does. Now, the next is uh is the pricing playbook. This thing's a killer. I already showed you a zillion testimonials for this thing. Um, I have God, I have so many pricing tweaks.
(3:43:38) I just put the top the top 10 instant ones that have the highest likelihood of of working with the most businesses and the pricing algorithms inside of it because so many questions are like, well, what do I do in this scenario? What do I do in this scenario? And so, basically just created if this, then that, rules of behaving around pricing that are inside of it, plus a whole bunch of other good stuff.
(3:43:56) Um, but this thing's a this thing's a monster. And I think I I told you Saint story, but like just repositioning how you're talking about your offer can shift how people perceive the price. And so that's also included inside of the pricing playbook.
(3:44:15) So it's not just like how can I change the price, but how can I change people's perception of my new price that now makes it seem like less than my original price even though it's higher. That's what that covers. And then finally, you have the price race playbook. So PC talked about this a little bit. Um PC and I have gone back and forth. He's led a ton of price raises. He said at 80% of the people, that's his estimate.
(3:44:33) Um, of the business that he worked with, they they they led a price raise. Um, for us, I mean, gosh, we do it so many times. I honestly a countless amount of times. What's interesting is it's such a high-risisk thing if done improperly. And so to pay down the the stress or the risk or the fear of failing around this um that's why that's why I created this playbook because many of you are going to you know read the pricing book and be like shoot how do I actually implement this or roll this out.
(3:44:56) That's what I created this playbook for. I'll show you how to position it, how to explain it. I'll give you the actual letters to send the post to put inside of the group how to explain it uh so that your people aren't, you know, pissed off at you uh for raising prices. And so you'll get all 12 of those for free if you just donate 200 books to other entrepreneurs.
(3:45:14) Okay. Um and you'll get it in this nice premium binder which you see there and you'll get in this really nice box over here. Okay. Beyond that, I train the ACQAI on all of these playbooks so that if you're like, "How do I make this work for a dry cleaning business? How do I make this work for a longare business? How to make this work for XYZ business?" This will help you do that. All right.
(3:45:31) Now, the battery on my iPad ran out, right? Um, and this I mean it's funny because I just like almost skipped over this, but it's harder for me to give examples besides the fact that I did 226 of these. Every single person that you see behind me um like they came from this like from this g like their their name's in here.
(3:45:52) Um, and they paid a huge amount of money in order to basically make this available for you. Okay, so that's inside of the ACQ AI. Beyond that, we have the ACQ virtual implementation workshop. Um this will help you use the tools that uh that we set out here so you can use them with skill um and ultimately get more leverage on the business and one of the cool benefits of this is that you can bring your team to uh to this workshop.
(3:46:10) Okay. So our workshops uh you know we have obviously we have cons we have advisory work and then we just have kind of uh workshops that are on the on the front end. Um those workshops that are on the front end are5 or $6,000 plus a piece and the one day advisory work is $35,000.
(3:46:29) And so you can bring these without any additional cost which I see is a pretty significant benefit. Again, all free when you donate 200 bucks. And uh last but not least um because I'm going to close this out. So if you have been if you've been on the fence, this is now is the time. Um we just broke the Guinness Book World Record. I would argue I don't want to be self grandizing, but I would say we shattered it.
(3:46:49) Um and the way we did it was everything that's inside of here. All right. said, "This launch blackbook contains I mean millions like literally not like not like fig like literally millions of dollars of work um and bets and decisions and the internal thinking process which might be more valuable than I think anything else because in a world of AI your ability to make decisions is going to be the thing that ultimately decides your fate because execution over time will be considerably you know diminished but it's who can decide what's the strategy how are we
(3:47:19) going to implement these tactics which are we going to do? That's the stuff that's going to drive the needle. And so, uh, this these launch assets, these collateral, like they just got that, so they work. Beyond this, I have some other questions. Okay, great. Um, yeah, so we had a couple questions for the Ultra Ballers that I had. So, I'll just talk to you guys about that.
(3:47:49) So, um, again, if you guys are checking out, go check out um because as soon as this is over, then we will, uh, we will we will terminate the live stream and then the launch bonus, which now is incredibly sexy because we just we just cracked the the Guinness World Record. Um, which was, you know, I mean, I hoped, but I didn't know.
(3:48:11) Um, but beyond that, uh, let me tell you about the about the the 800 book offer. All right. So, you guys would you guys like to hear about that? Actually, would you guys like to hear about that? Okay. then I will tell you guys about that indeed. Okay. So, I thought to myself like what would be what would be really compelling and so the number one request that I've had for years has been can we have a group from Rosie Nation, right? And I I want to be 100 transparent 100% transparent with you. Like I didn't want to start a community that was going to become the
(3:48:42) comment section in general. That sounded horrible. And I was like, I think that will actually make me not enjoy what I do. And so I thought, okay, how can I solve for like making something that I would really like and if I really like it, then other people who are business owners that are higher level would also enjoy it too.
(3:49:02) And so what we did was I thought, okay, number one is that I do like working with businesses. I do have time constraints, but this was actually like some of the most fun that I've had in a really long time. The reason I do hormones hotline cash cows is because like I would do I I would do it for free, right? Uh people are willing to pay so I charge but like I would do it for free. I really enjoy it. Um just like the questions that we answered earlier like I enjoy it.
(3:49:25) So the first thing that you get when you donate 800 books which we also credit the 200 towards it. So while this launch is going on uh the 200 gets credited. So there's only 600 more books um which you can pay for I think $3,000 extra today. So, basically, you pay six to donate the 200 and then on the next page, you can just pay $3,000 more and you get everything I'm about to say. So, number one is you'll be able to have direct access to me and it's only for six months.
(3:49:50) And again, I'm doing this because I wanted to break the record. We've already broken it, but I I I'm a man of my word. I will stick with the the window being open um for, you know, until, you know, until the time till till the time it ends. Um I will give you a hint though. Um well, I'll I'll just say this independently. The record is uh only for 24 hours.
(3:50:12) So I'll just say that I'm not saying when this ends, but I'm saying the record is for 24 hours. Um so in the spirit of that, the first thing that anybody who chooses to upgrade on the thank you page gets is uh it'll be direct access uh to me specifically, meaning you'll be able to ask questions inside of the community um and share the tactics that are working well for you right now uh for you and everyone else.
(3:50:36) And so I will I am allocating time in order to answer these questions. And I think that the alpha on an answer can be everything. I think and so that's why I'm doing it. Um but I'm again I'm gating this for six months. I'm not doing it for any longer than that just because I think I know how much work bu you know building and maintaining a community is.
(3:50:57) Um I said it like I have been voted the number one person in every network that I've entered when they ever had an award or like most likely to or member of the year or whatever. I've I've won that in just about every single community that I've entered. I was vice president of my powerlifting team. I was president of my fraternity.
(3:51:14) Um almost every group that I've joined that had an award I won. And I I've done that because I will give more than everyone else will. And so I was very hesitant to do this because I know how much of a time commitment it is. But I'm willing to do it because I wanted to break this record because I think entrepreneurs should own this this darn thing since we're the ones who pay the we're the ones who pay the taxes, right? like we should at least, you know, own the scoreboard.
(3:51:37) So, that's the first thing. The next thing is that you'll get access to my team, to my actual portfolio team. So, this is my directors. These are the people that people pay $35,000 for to have a day with. And so, I want to be clear here, like my team is really good. And it's one of those unfortunate things that like if you've never experienced really high level talent, it's one of those like you you need to see it to believe it type things.
(3:52:01) But I'll just say this, like the best people on my team make 500, 800 million plus a year. Not commission based people. They're just really good at what they do. And you don't pay that kind of money unless someone's really good. And so, um, some of you guys will see some of the videos of people talking about like a common theme is like, man, the team's so good. The only reason we could do this is because the team's good. It's not like I can do all this stuff.
(3:52:25) Like I was here, like you guys been watching me talk, right? Like the only reason this could even happen was because of, you know, 50, 100 plus other people that are making sure everything else behind the scenes is working, right? Um, so it's me, it's the team. So in terms of the team, it's director of recruiting, director of investment, director of strategy, uh, director of sales, director of marketing.
(3:52:44) So if you're like, man, I'm struggling with my ads, I'm struggling with my content, uh, you know, my sales aren't converting the way they should be. You know, my show rates suck. Um, I'm having struggling to to find this specific person from a talent perspective.
(3:52:56) That's like you can ask all those questions and they're resp like we'll be in there, right? Um so that's the second thing. The third thing is that this is all obviously housed inside of a school community. Now the benefits of that is that you'll get access to each other and if you were buy you know if you're donating books to help other entrepreneurs you just you vi you know like you're you're going to be surrounded by other people who who who are the same way, right? They're going to be giving first. They're going to be more reciprocity driven in general. Um,
(3:53:22) and there's also a really cool feature in school where you can, it doesn't dox you, but you put it, you can basically put yourself on a map. Gives you 10 milei radius. You're not showing your your home address, but then you can just see every person in all of Mosy Nation. That's a baller who's in your city.
(3:53:41) And so, I'm I'm hoping that we can facilitate the meetups of just a bunch of really sick entrepreneurs. And like, there's really nothing that has changed my life more than the people who've entered it. And so I wanted to facilitate that at scale uh for Mosie Nation and I wanted to do it that so that we could do this together.
(3:54:00) And so that's the the second thing you get or third thing you get. Um now the fourth and obviously you have access to one another that's you know joint joint joint ventures partnerships um and just relationships. That sounds a bit sounds a bit off doesn't it? It's yeah. Okay moving on. So the fourth um is something that you might not have expected.
(3:54:19) So, we do a lot of deals at acquisition.com. I'm not as public about them, and I'll tell you why. Um, I I revealed a couple of the portfolio companies today, but the the big one is just that I I don't there's very there's very little benefit I get from basically making brand associations because then I become basically that company becomes beholden to me. And so, if you're ever to sell that company in the future, I have to go with the deal.
(3:54:43) And most companies don't, you know, like I I don't want to put money into something and then say, "Okay, now I'm beholden to this thing for the rest of my life, right?" And so I will be showing the deals that we're doing behind the scenes. Um, and I think one of the really cool things that has really advanced me as an entrepreneur is some of the wealth and tax strategies.
(3:55:00) I'm going to dive into this a little bit more. Um, I didn't, you know, it's like my like my understanding of finance has so dramatically improved some from the time I sold my company until today. It's mindblowing.
(3:55:20) Like what do you think the number one strategy for decreasing your taxes is as an entrepreneur? Do you think it's like learning all these things about the tax code? No, it's not that. And this was a big misconception that I had. It's about learning how to do your finances in such a way that you can basically still generate the cash flow that you need to, but then structure them in such a way that you just have lower taxable income overall.
(3:55:37) I was like, whoa, I didn't know you could do that. And so, I'll share some of the strategies that we do at a higher level um for business owners so that you can decrease your taxable income. Um, now obviously if you're in a country that that already has no taxes, then amazing for you. Love this for you.
(3:55:51) uh but for everyone else especially US based and I would imagine that many of these accounting practices probably carry in most developed countries. So that's one um beyond that there's obviously the the the more tax code related stuff which will benefit specifically more US companies.
(3:56:09) Um but we'll share some of the things that would work exceptionally well for us um that you can that you can use and again that's not a promise you know your results will vary etc. Um, but these things are things that like you just pop one of these in and it's like for the rest of your career you can use it every single year. And so these are it's what's crazy about these types of uh strategies is that they are purely declarative knowledge meaning until you know about them like like the day you learn it it's just tremendously valuable and then you get to use it forever which is like if you think about the compounding value of knowledge especially for this type of stuff from a tax perspective it's like if I know how to decrease my t my effective tax rate
(3:56:42) to you know from 37% to 20 23%. This is not me saying it's going to happen for you. I'm just saying like hypothetically if you knew how to use uh the tax system better and you could do that. It's like that compounding of the savings over the rest of your career is just mind-numbing like blowing how much how how much of a difference it makes at the end.
(3:56:59) And so we're going to be sharing that stuff. Chiron specifically obviously he's you know president of a publicly traded company um knows how to do things by the book super compliantly. Um, and he's been a huge a huge help for me in basically leveling me up to to kind of like the public level of of financial operations and accounting um especially when it comes to tax drag and things like that. And so we'll be sharing some of these strategies um with you guys.
(3:57:24) Now, there's one more thing that we give uh to anyone who who uh donates 800 more bucks, which is $3,000 extra. Okay, this is what it is. Um this is the lead system. This is the sales system. This is delivery system. This is the profit system. I will be leading an event like this but only about the lead system month one.
(3:57:48) The next month and these are not in order but like just say as we go I'll do one entire workshop on the sales system, one entire workshop just on delivery retention LTV, one on profit and I'm spacing them out once a month so that you can actually implement this stuff.
(3:58:08) And so it's what Augustish, end of August. So there's six of these in total. So there's four, there's two more. One is people and AI. So Leila's going to show you how we're increasing our leverage per headcount using AI. And now how to incorporate into the operations of the business. And so that's going to be a deep training same as wealth, wealth, which is what uh what Chiron will lead.
(3:58:27) So that's six in total. Okay. So leads, sales, delivery, profit. Each of those I will lead. Chiron will lead wealth and tax. Uh and then Leila will lead people in AI. And so you will be able to have that. Uh and you can invite your teams now within the community. I only want founders and business owners because it's just cooler. It's better.
(3:58:49) Um but your teams can come to all of the events which again it's like if you have one like it's we we charge $35,000 a day. There's six of them. If you bring your team like like what are we talking about? You know what I mean? Um, so all of that is free when when you get to the thank you page, uh, you pay $3,000 more dollars and then there's, uh, five installments of $3,000 a month for the next five months.
(3:59:15) And the whole point of this is that you can set you up for Q1, right? You can do this now, hit Q4 strong, and then get set up to crush 26. That's why I did it. And then after that, you'll have install basically, you'll have the time each month to install this stuff inside of your business. And then after installing it, you can reap the benefits.
(3:59:34) And the benefit of all of that stuff is many of these systems are onetime setups. And so obviously some of these things like you're gonna have to keep running ads. But once you learn how to break through an ad spend ceiling, you can continue to do it. And like I said earlier, like we spent 500,000 I think like yesterday on ads just for this event.
(3:59:51) And so I bring this up to say like you have to know how to scale uh in order to like break through these ceilings in order to really scale. So, that's all the stuff that is uh in addition for anyone who's a little bit little bit more senior, a little bit more premium business owner.
(4:00:06) Um that is the that is the offer that I have behind the scenes uh for you guys. Now, what's crazy is that you might not have noticed this, but I have not peed or eaten. Um and I don't know how many hours we've been going. Um but I will still continue to go strong. The beer is I think what what hit me.
(4:00:26) Um, the double beer, the tall boy that the that I was forced to drink. Um, but that was for the Aussies. You guys rock. Actually, I think Aussies are probably waking up at this point. So, if I have any Australians in here, let me know. Uh, let me know in the chat real quick. Let me know if you guys uh are are here. Do I have some Aussies, some New Zealanders? Yes. Okay.
(4:00:46) Um, so I think I think with this with this uh moment I really do have to pee. Um, I think I'm going to probably uh I don't know. I mean, do you guys like Do you have do you have other questions? Hey, can you show me the um I know we have three different chats going. Can you show me one of the other chats on this screen? I want to see some of the questions that are coming up. Also, if we have any other questions that came up from uh Thanks.
(4:01:15) I I don't even want to eat anything. I just give me the FAQs. What other questions we got? They keep like bringing cookies out. But I'm not eating them. I like I keep putting them over there. I'm fine. I'm like I'm I'm I'm grooving. This is fun, right? This is a cool way to spend a Saturday. You're in New York and you're tired. Chloe, what's up? Appreciate you.
(4:01:41) So, when I I'm I'm keeping this open because I know some of you guys are are finishing checking out right now. Um because otherwise the launch bonus that just broke the Guinness record uh will disappear. So, if you do it, do it now. Um, did we swap the uh Mike? We swap the chat. I wonder if I can go all day and not pay. I can do it. I believe.
(4:02:09) What are you willing to do to get more books into the hands of entrepreneurs? At least a few things. All right. So, all right. They're switching it out. They're switching it out. Here we go. Okay. Thank God. Here we go. Now I can see it. Okay. You guys rock. Oh, you guys are awesome. Thank you guys. Thank you. Okay. Live Q&A questions. Here we go. You guys are fast.
(4:02:37) They printed this out. Rock and roll, man. This is sick. Oh, this is great. You guys rock. Hell yeah. Oh, that's cool. Okay. So, um live Q&A question. So, Wheatland Dental Care. So, dental office uh offers cleaners, treatment, cosmetic work, free cleaning with insurance, $99 without uh then recommend treatment. Question.
(4:03:02) How do you build a strong money model when insurance contracts lock in your pricing? It's a great question. Um, so one of the things is that you want to think about is I'll give you the I'll give you like this is not me trying to push this but like well you this is me trying to push it. Um, these things will help you more than the book will if you're in insurance.
(4:03:27) Okay? Okay. And the reason I'm explaining this is that this is a lot of the things that you can do to reimagine the pricing, reimagine how things are positioned so that you can get like I can make this free and not this free. When you have insurance, you have to use other levers. And so this is for like this just the the book, right? The book is for uh really just businesses that are for-profit standard businesses.
(4:03:52) The money models implementation stuff is stuff that you can immediately use inside of your own uh business to just improve overall. Okay. Okay. And that these are like if you if you make money from insurance, then getting more leads to show up will make you more money. Right? If you get lease from insurance, having more people find out about your stuff will make you more money. If you can close and despite the fact that it is insurance, you still have to make the sale. You still get them to say yes.
(4:04:10) If you can close better, you will make more. Again, not a promise that's going to happen, but just saying hypothetically here. Um, that is how that works. Okay? So, these are the things that actually drive more in that type of business. Um now so a lot of in the insurance space it's like you're going to have to learn your billing system extremely well.
(4:04:29) Um meaning like what are the billable services? Are there ways that we can find more billable services? How can we introduce those things such that we can get a high percentage of people to take us up on those? So you can absolutely still juice the hell out of LTV.
(4:04:42) It's just how do we create that kind of customer journey customer map. So that's how I'd be thinking about this but a lot of it is going to be one in execution when you're in an insurancebased business. And I would imagine that you're probably supply constraint uh which is going to be more talent based because most insurance people or people who run predominantly on insurance have decent demand because the cost is effectively free for many people.
(4:05:05) And so if that's the case then usually it's like I run out of good talent which means margin becomes an issue because you're like well I can't pay people better because they cap my prices and so then becomes better at operational constraints of like how can I run this business more efficiently. So you just have to walk through the logical tree. Um, and that's that's I mean, uh, the AI can help you with some of these things.
(4:05:22) Okay, so, uh, Kitty Cox, Civil Productions, we sell Madden and College Football Gaming. Oh, no, I already covered that one. Uh, Easy Cell Florida. Okay. We make cash offers to homeowners. I already covered that one. Basil, we already covered that one. Super Smush Gummies. HMA. Trilogy Chiropractic. Okay. Uh, all right. Trilogy Chiropractic. People and animals.
(4:05:40) So, chiropractic care for people and animals. $97 intro visit into corrective care into recurring wellness. Okay. Was there a question? They just gave me a summary of their business. All right, we're just going to go with Matt. So, Apogee Strong.
(4:06:06) Apogee is a missiondriven education and leadership company serving parents, students, and entrepreneurs. What's up, Matt? Uh revenue comes from coaching programs for men and families, personal growth coaching, K12 campus licensing and live events. How would you design financial the financial engine so each stream grows individually while also multiplying the growth of the others without creating uh creating drag? Okay. So this is a really important question.
(4:06:23) So I'm going to tell you a story to answer your question. So I had a lady who came to uh one of the one of the workshops we we did to collect the data to build all this stuff. And she had a a uh she had a two-parted business, right? So she did hair, she taught people to do uh extensions, I think, and then she also had like business coaching to like help them, you know, grow their business.
(4:06:52) And so when she had the hair extensions thing, she said, "Well, you know, this is $10,000 and the other thing is, you know, $4,000 or something like that." And so she's so she said, "Which should I like which should I be promoting?" I said, "So what's LTV to CAC?" And so LTV to CAC for the business thing was 10 to1.
(4:07:10) and LTV to CACAC for the hair thing to end consumer of like just teaching people how to do extensions was I think it was like 20 or 30 to1 is way bigger 30 to1 and so she had these two business 10 to1 and 31 amazing it was great to have both either of those numbers right and so she said you know what how how do I promote these things and so I said reality is you don't have two frontends you have one front end which is your 30 to1 which has a way higher TAM way more people want to learn how to do hair extensions and if you can make 30 to1 on a way bigger TAM then that's either your only business or you tack on the 10 to one on the back. And so when answering the question like how would I think
(4:07:39) through the financial engine I would look at what's the LTV to CAC between each of these things and how can I create a seamless customer handoff between each uh each of the business units and if I can do that then I can create a straight line of business and a money model that I can that my whole team can understand that's the idea okaybody fitness jacktory so we sell online personal training to equestrians okay Cool. We have a 3-month 3K front end and a 9month backend at 4500. Okay.
(4:08:11) What would be the best way to maximize retention in LTV? Margins are beginning to shrink. Okay. So, good news and bad news, right? So, if you're online longterm, you have to build a brand. It's going to be the long-term strategy. Otherwise, CAC is always going to go up. So, you either have to do you have to you have to counter that by building a better brand, getting more inbound for free.
(4:08:34) Option one. Option two, extending the LTV of the customer so that you can afford the increased price. Ideally, you do both, right? I'm just saying like thinking long term here now because if you have the brand, then you can charge more and you'll have a bigger reputation. Um, and then you'll also have less cash, so you'll get a double double.
(4:08:52) Like you'll increase how much you charge and it'll cost you less to make the money. Now, the 3K to 4500, those prices seem I don't know. I'm not I'm not sold on those yet. Um, but if I wanted to maximize LT, I would probably use one of the money models that I talked about, which is a rollover. So, I would say, hey, how can I make the, you know, I I can make this a 10k backend? Because if you're doing three months, 3K, that means $1,000 a month for three months, and then $4,500 over 9 months is $500 a month. So, it's half the price on the back end. So, it's like, okay, how can I
(4:09:23) take this $3,000 thing and then credit it towards, let's say, a $7,000. So, it's like 10k on the back end, but I'll take your three credit towards 10, drop it to seven. So, now you're at um basically a a higher effective rate.
(4:09:44) So, instead of 4,500, you're getting you're getting paid seven, but they see a price drop from 10 uh to seven. So, you'll make more on the back end. You also get a higher take rate because you'll use one of the money model mechanisms. Um, and that's what I would do like to immediately increase LTV, but I would still long term like you got to start making more content.
(4:10:00) Um, so that you can come on more established as a brand. Uh, otherwise CAC is going to continue to rise. Okay. Equab body. I got that one covered. Oh, I think I found my people and animals. I got it. I got the second half of this one. Okay. So, $97 chiropractic care for people and animals. 97 bucks into intracorrective care into recurring wellness.
(4:10:24) So this is doctors Paul and Brianna Kundiff. So they did 1.3 million trailing revenue 41% animals for 59% humans. This is crazy. So team of 11 including three animal certified doctors exploring a high ticket platinum pause VIP package bundling pet care with grooming, dental training and and photography via partners. Okay. Question.
(4:10:54) What should a grand slam offer model be for this business? Man, y'all do a lot of stuff. It's like you couldn't even get narrow to one species. Um I feel like like it's so weird. It's it's an odd business. Let me be real with you. 60% human, 40% animal. It's it's actually the first I've heard where there's two. Sounds like you. 40% human. 60% human, 40% animal. 40% animal staying up here. I will take that. No pee breaks, no nothing, no water. Yeah, I Well, Alex is a streamer now.
(4:11:22) That's right. Um, what would you do there? Are you going to take this so I can pee? Yep. Thank god. Okay. I didn't actually know what the question was, but if you tell me which question.  Okay. How did they create a grand slam offer for animals? I'm peeing. You guys rock. I'll be back in five minutes. Thank you guys.
(4:11:40) Uh, when the stream cuts off, the launch collateral disappears. The one that broke the Guinness record. All right. Be back in a second. We call this a hostile takeover, if you know what I'm saying. Um, okay, let's find this. I don't see anything about animals. This is odd. All right, let's see. All right, I'm just going to take some questions from the chat, guys. Oh, here we're good.
(4:12:13) I don't even know what this means, but good good good luck writing that on the on the thing. All right. I own a local business. Did we answer this one? We have one location. I want to open a second location, but I'm hesitant. What are the signs my business is ready to expand? We're currently at about $430,000 a month.
(4:12:32) Um, it's interesting. So signs that you're ready to expand when you're thinking about a service business or a a brick-and-mortar location business is first thing I'll say is like that the business isn't relying on you right now in terms of time.
(4:12:50) So if right now for you to make the $430,000 a month you are involved in the daytoday and you're making decisions in the day-to-day and the week to week then I would say that's probably not the right time to say I'm going to expand. The first thing that you want to do is you want to get it off your plate so that you're not involved at all.
(4:13:10) So, that's the first thing that we want to do is say, "Okay, I need to get to a point where it's making the $430,000 a month, but I'm not involved in it, right? I'm just doing a touch base with the leadership team or whatever that might look like." The second thing is that if you look at your uh CAC to LTV ratio, you want to make sure that it's super healthy because as your business scales, if you want to continue to scale to other locations, you have to assume that over time the cost of acquisition is going to increase uh and your lifetime value might decrease as you bring on more people, more hires, you more locations, the market gets saturated, your product isn't as new. And so you want to have it
(4:13:38) so you're probably at like, you know, I would say like I would love to see something at between we like 80% gross margins. Um 90 would be better. Um but that's not possible for all businesses. Um so that you can withstand a lower a higher cost of acquisition and a lower LTV as you scale the model. So you are not involved in the business.
(4:14:00) You have a really healthy uh CAC to LTV ratio. you. Um, and then I would say that the next piece that I would look at is um, I also like to say like what's the quality of the revenue? So, is your revenue is it all driven off of like discounts and promotions and like people that never come back in churn or is it high quality revenue where essentially um, it's all people that you're retaining, they're coming back, they're really happy.
(4:14:26) Um, you're not discounting things, you're not cheapening the product, and people keep saying good things. And so there's a little bit of intangible there. I think a lot of people are always looking at the metrics and that's that part is a little bit more metric driven and like quantitative.
(4:14:44) If you look on the qualitative side, if I'm looking at scaling, I'm going to ask myself, okay, well, what is like word on the street? What are people actually saying about my business? What are my customers saying about the experience that they have? And is it going in the right direction? Like is it getting better or is it getting worse? Now, it's interesting because a lot of people say, "Well, if you can't measure it, then it doesn't exist.
(4:15:00) " That's guys. Um, and I think Jeff Bezos said this and I think it's like the most it's one of the truest things that I've ever stuck to in business, which is if you have to go with the data versus the commentary, go with the commentary. And he talked about this in a lot of different interviews with Amazon. It's like, well, the data says this.
(4:15:17) It's like, all right, well, but when I talk to the customers, this is what they're saying. It's like, well, because the data, it might not be measuring the right thing. It might be off. It might we don't know. And so, that being said, I always go with the commentary. So, if you're wondering if you should expand, I think those are a couple of the things that I'd be looking at. Um, make sure you're not involved in the day-to-day to make that money.
(4:15:35) Make sure that you have a healthy CAC to LTV. Make sure people are saying good things. And make sure that uh you have the resources to take 50% of your attention and put it towards the next location and nothing would happen to this one. I think a lot of people think, oh, you know what? I'm just going to hire a person. It's gonna It's like a baby.
(4:15:53) It's like the new location when you open a second or third location. Those of you who have done this, you know, a lot of the time it is. It's like, okay, it's kind of like starting all over. Like it needs that in the beginning. That does that mean that you need to be that involved forever? No. But like in the beginning it is. Just like for acquisition.
(4:16:10) com, you know, it's like we have the private equity, the advisory practice, the venture capital. Like you can ask my team. I'm very involved in the beginning of every single thing we do, but I very quickly get myself out of things. And so the same goes for like if you're if you have a physical location business and you're looking to scale.
(4:16:28) But the key is is that you can't be stuck in one of them before you start the next one. Because for me, for example, if I'm too involved in anything, then I don't have the luxury of moving around to then go start the next thing, go get deeply involved in the new product or uh division that we're going to start for acquisition.
(4:16:46) And so it's like at some point you kind of have to be as the founder or the CEO of your company, you have to be like the head generalist. It's like you have the most general knowledge of anybody of the entire thing, but you can't go super deep on everything all the time.
(4:17:03) And you also have to be okay with that because it's a little bit of an ego hit sometimes and you're like, "Wow, somebody else knows more than me." Geez. Let's look at some more questions we got here. How do you decide what things to associate your brand with if you are starting from scratch as a faceless company? You know, I'll be honest. Um I have never like people ask me a lot like how do you build a brand? And I'm like it's it's interesting because like I don't consider myself to have like an insanely large brand or anything like that. Um and Alex is obviously he has a bigger brand than me.
(4:17:36) I will say this, which I think he would agree with, which is like your brand is just you. And I actually think that a lot of the times when pe people think too much about it, when it's a personal brand, they're like, "What should my personal brand be?" And I'm like, "I don't know. How are you?" Like, "I'm a little weird. That's okay. It's part of my personal brand.
(4:17:53) Like, that's fine, right?" And so, like, whoever you are, it's going to come out one way or the other. And I see a lot of people go wrong because they have a personal brand, right? They are one person. And then they're like, "Oh, well, I could never show this side to people because then I would lose customers or this or that.
(4:18:11) " And so then they show like a piece of it and they just seem like a shell. They seem like another person on YouTube or Instagram or whatever. And so I actually think that in order to build a really robust uh timeless personal brand, you have to go all in on just being you. And the thing is about you is that you have certain things you like and they might contradict each other.
(4:18:29) You might like to work really hard and then watch Love Love Island at night. I don't know anybody who does that. Um, you might like to, you know, bake cookies for your husband and make dinner at home, but also just like work your ass off all day. I swore, I'm sorry. Uh, and run a business and be a CEO. Again, me, right? It's like things that contradict.
(4:18:51) And for me, in the beginning when I first started my uh making content, I remember thinking like, "Oh gosh, if I show people like I love makeup and fashion and like, you know, I do like nice things sometimes. I like to spend money and like you know I like baking for my husband and I like watching Love Island. Like if I show those things then people aren't going to take me seriously.
(4:19:11) And it's so funny because I remember in the beginning like I actually started making content and the opposite happened is that I remember people were like she's a robot she's this. She's that. And I'm like man what? And I'm like people hate me and that's not even me. And as soon as I started showing another side to myself which was just always there. I just didn't show it on camera then it was like my brand started really growing a lot faster.
(4:19:28) And so I think for a lot of you um the root of having a good self uh you know um personal brand is just self-acceptance. It's like you have to accept yourself and all your all your flaws. And if you do that you'll showcase it to other people.
(4:19:44) And you know at the end of the day I I said this to one of our leaders the other day. I said like people don't look for somebody who's perfect. They look for somebody who works hard for somebody who's relatable for somebody who they can aspire to but they don't expect perfection. And I think the same goes for a brand. I think if you try to be perfect to put a brand out there and you have the perfect associations and you can never go wrong and you can never that's going to be so much pressure you're just never going to want to do it. You know, like I can come up here and be on this live stream with I don't
(4:20:07) even know how many people are on this right now, but I don't feel nervous at all because I'm like listen my brand is not about perfection at all because I'm a human and I mess up all the time. And so like I make that one of the core things I talk about because I never want someone to think that I'm not going to make a mistake.
(4:20:26) I will and I will just respond well to it and I will make up for it, right? So I would say in general when I think about associations I think about okay what are the things that I actually am about like what do I like what are the big chunks in my life like what takes up the time of my day right okay I like working out I like hanging out with my husband I like running the business I like baking I like uh okay yeah at night I like watching Love Island before I go to bed like those are things right and so it's like all right whatever takes up the chunks of your day those are probably the associations
(4:20:50) don't try and fabricate things because you will be found out and Like it's just interesting. I think it's just like business. People are like, "Oh gosh, like um you know there's this or there's this trend or this." And I'm like, "Yeah, but do you want to be a trend or do you want to be timeless?" And you can only be timeless if you are you? And like there's a million people out there writing trends.
(4:21:12) And I will tell you, I don't I don't even scroll my damn phone. I don't even know what the trends are. I'm just like just got to be you. And there's like if if I have to be me and like people hate me and I never have a brand, then so be it. But like if you build a brand based off of like what associations you think you're supposed to have, you're just going to be miserable.
(4:21:30) And so I would say like don't put so much thought into it. Just be you and people the right people will love you and the right people will also hate you so you can ignore them. Cool. Landon, how to manage remote work via weekly reports? Um interesting. So, I would say that reports. Yeah, come on up. My bestie, Chiron. I'll read stuff to you. Go ahead.
(4:21:55) No, no, and then you can take some, too. Um, so weekly reports. Um, it's interesting. I think that these are the most helpful for when you have people that are remote and probably not as great at communication. Now, I'll tell you why.
(4:22:13) Because a lot of times if I'm speaking with an executive on my team, I might not even need a weekly report from them because they're very good at already knowing what to give me. So the less experienced someone is in the organization and the further away from you they are meeting remote, the more likely it is you need a weekly report.
(4:22:31) And so you design it by saying, "What information do I need from this person in order to effectively manage them?" I tend to ask for a few things. I say, "Uh, what was your number one win this week? What was your top challenge this week? How can I support you going into the next week? And where are you at with your MITs? What are MITs? They're essentially like what I have somebody doing. They're their initiatives or their projects for that quarter.
(4:22:51) And so that gives them the space to essentially think like, okay, where did I do well? Where did I not do well? Where do I need support from Leila? And how am I going to uh you know, how's my progress towards my goals? And so that's the sweet spot for me with check-ins.
(4:23:08) Now, if somebody is, let's say, a super individual contributor, like we're talking about like a customer support rep and they're inexperienced, I'm also going to ask them for their stats, uh, and also like their stats towards goal. So, like, how close are you to hitting your goals? I'm going to probably ask them a few more intricate questions.
(4:23:26) Now, why is that? Because they might not have the skill of when I ask them a more open-ended question of giving me the right answer. So, I'd say just in general rule of thumb, the least experience and the further away, the more that you want to have very specific targeted questions. And then the more experience, the closer to you, the more they can have open vague questions or you don't need as much reporting.
(4:23:43) Would you add anything to that? The only thing I would add is that um no one likes it when someone turns in a weekly report and the manager does not respond in some way. Oh, yeah. Reinforcement. So if if someone is turning in a weekly report to you and you're not responding to it at all and all you're doing is just reading it and saying sure I got it and that's a checkbox for you then after a while I'm just going to get into a B minus way of actually doing reporting.
(4:24:07) So um you know for Leila and I every single thing that that someone turns into us on a weekly report we respond and comment on every single thing because they actually made the effort to sharing with you what they did. So the least you can do is acknowledge that support that you know celebrate that or what have you around that.
(4:24:21) So if you are asking for a weekly report, there's an 8020. 80% of them 80% of the effort is them delivering to you. 20% of is you responding back, thousand%. Yeah. Okay. Before we go to the next question, let's we got to show our kicks because you got these for us. The you guys see this? Can they see on the camera? The acquisition.com. Acquisition.com, baby.
(4:24:38) So good. It's good. Awesome. The small things. I know. Um this is good. Um, how do you decide what things to associate your brand with if you're starting from scratch as a faceless company? Oh, I just answered that one. Oh, you did. Sorry. Oops. It's okay. So, what's the next one? Let's see. Oh gosh, that was okay.
(4:25:04) Oh, I did that one, too. Oh, it went backwards. That's why. Oh, that's weird. Okay. I'm Okay. In a boutique accounting firm where technical skills is non-negotiable but the pool of top talent is limited. What frameworks or incentives would you prioritize to attract, filter and retain A players? Ask you that one.
(4:25:24) Yeah. So, um they're A players are difficult, right? Because you need you need uh A players generally do have cost 10 to 30% more. They probably will deliver 10x better results. Uh it's it's hard because you have no idea what the A player wants. So there's there's a few things that you can kind of flex and comp.
(4:25:48) A lot of what people ought to think is salary is the only comp. Like it's not right. Leila will always say, hey, you get freedom, freedom of time, freedom of location, freedom of growth. So what are the first what are the non-negotiable like what are the non-monetary things that are available that you can actually use? I would start to actually make a list of them. Hey, we offer unlimited PTO.
(4:26:06) We you can work from home x number of days a week. you can take x amount of time off. You have um we pay for your benefits, we pay for your gym, we cover your entire 401k match. Like there's other these non like non-base salary oriented stuff that are important. So when you think about comp, you've got that.
(4:26:24) The second thing you have is the actual comp itself, right? And um I'll tell you about the actual base comp is you may have to go a little more, but uh you can get the A player talent with that, but the your incentive comp is going to be the biggest thing when it comes to a player talent. So I'll give you a couple examples for incentive comp. Incentive comp idea number one is um formulaic bonuses.
(4:26:41) A players love formulas. They're like, "Hey, if I do these six things, I get X result." They feel good because it incentivizes to them to do that thing. That's number one. The second is is u a companywide like a teamwide bonus. If your team delivers all of these things, now they're, you know, their their lead to get that. Great.
(4:26:59) Third is you can offer equity without offering equity. You know, there's this idea of phantom equity. And the phantom equity is they still get the share of profits or the share of the equity without you having to change ownership structure and you can structure that in any way that you want. So just you can start you know Google phantom equity.
(4:27:16) So you still give people ownership in something without actually having to dilute your own ownership. But I'll give you the last but not least one really great idea to give you further incentive is this idea of getting them to stay for a longer time with a pot of gold at the end. So let's say you set up a I'm making up an idea. Let's say you set up a life insurance policy for them. Let's say you start contributing to that policy.
(4:27:34) Say, "Hey, Leila, while you're with us, I'm going to contribute $100,000 to this policy every single year." Right? And then at the end of 10 years when you're with us, you can take all the appreciation including all of that. Now, this forces them to stay for the 10 years, you got to have button C to actually get that result, right? So now, but till that time, for that 10 years, I can borrow against the policy to actually do something with on a daily basis to run the operations of the firm as well. So, you can structure incentive deals where you you don't have to give
(4:27:58) equity, but you can give equity. You don't have to give a bonus, but you can give a bonus. You can make it formulaic. You can make it about the team and you can also force them to stay with you much longer as well. The key part is figuring out what is important for Leila is probably not what is important for me and then knowing.
(4:28:15) So, you might have to customize that a little bit. I don't know how what you would add to that. Honestly, that was incredibly thorough. So, I would say yes. I think um some of the frames in terms of like understanding what's important to people tends to be this is not always but I will say like the younger somebody is the more that cash is very important to them especially because somebody if you look even like okay let's say 18 to 30 think about the amount of expenses somebody has they're usually buying a house starting a family buying a car like they have a lot of cash expenditure and so I've seen that people within that range
(4:28:43) tend to want cash heavy incentives bonuses salary etc and they forgo any kind of long-term I think after that I see more switching, right? It's like above say like 30 to, you know, the grave. No, because then it probably switches at some point. You're like, "Screw it. I'm going out soon. I need some cash.
(4:29:03) " Um, but 30 up, like people are looking at long term. They're like, "I want to be in it for the long run. I don't have as many cash expenditures." So, like, what becomes important to them is making sure that they're going to have those things that take care of them, not just now, but also in the future. Right. Right. Mhm.
(4:29:20) Um could you talk maybe briefly about the uh what we learned from relocation and then kind of baking that into the process? Yeah. So I would say that um a couple things that we've also learned at acquisition that we were actually literally just having a meeting about yesterday is um relocation for example. So we started as a remote company. So Acquisition.
(4:29:38) com, you know, gosh, we well, we founded it five years ago, but really started it four years ago and we were remote. And so our ability to get talent, it was really easy to get people remotely because it's like, okay, I just I just have to like log into Zoom on Monday and I'm on I'm in a different company.
(4:29:54) It's not a big deal, right? Um, and about gosh, I want to say it was about 10 months ago, um, especially after if you guys were on earlier, you heard me talk about us starting our advisory practice. Well, that's all in person here in Las Vegas at our headquarters. And so what I was noticing is that I wasn't getting as much top off of funnel for our talent.
(4:30:13) And I was like, well, why is that? And so what I realized is when we like kept like twisting the the screw and like what is going on? it was that we didn't have a relocation package, which is so silly to think about that we didn't think about this, but I was like, "Oh my gosh, we we very quickly grew and went from hiring all remote to in person and these people have to be very competent. They have extremely impressive backgrounds. A lot of them have young families.
(4:30:38) And so there's a lot that goes into, okay, you have to be a highly skilled person. You have a lot that you're giving up when you move. And then you have a lot of logistical things that you have to figure out when you relocate. And so we said, "Oh, we just have to put together a sick relocation package for people.
(4:30:55) " And I would say on top of it, um, how I approach a relocation package or honestly any package for somebody who is highly compensated, highly skilled, um, and hard to find is that you have to know what's important to them. So for some people with relocating, what's important is that we might cover their ability to fly back and see their family whenever they want.
(4:31:12) For some people, when they relocate, they might actually want job assistance for their spouse who needs to relocate their job. For some people, they might want to talk to somebody else who has kids in the school system. And so, some of it's not even monetary.
(4:31:29) Some of it's just connecting them, using your network, just going above and beyond to make them comfortable. And so, again, if you're relocating people and you're an inerson business, that's definitely something to consider. Yeah, super good. All right, phones open. Do you want to do this? Uh, all right. Let's talk about this one. Uh, operator's question. I assume that's what that means.
(4:31:52) Um, I made some assumptions about my business growing that did not turn out to be true. Happens to all of us. I have h overhired for a department and my operations are all over the place. How do you think about restructuring your org chart to be as efficient as possible for business? All right. Good. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.
(4:32:09) I'm going to start with a frame and I'm going to kick it to you. Go for it. Uh the frame I will tell you is that um welcome to business. Yeah. And we all make these mistakes. And I had a I have a really I had a really great mentor tell me who mentored a lot of people with all billionaires. Um he said, "Layla, you're always going to undersshoot or overshoot. You will never perfectly plan your hiring.
(4:32:33) " And I made a decision right then. I was like, "Okay, well, how do I want to do it?" Right? because it's either like you hire ahead or you hire behind. And so the first frame that I ask you is are you going to need these people in the next 6 to 10 months? That's the first thing you got to think about. You might and that's so that when I ask somebody, they're like, I overhired.
(4:32:50) I'm like, well do you need them in six to 10 months? Because if so, we might just want to bite the bullet and say if they're great people and we simply overhired by a little too much, that might not be a bad thing because now we have excess capacity. So it's not going to be a constraint when we grow. Now, if you tell me no, I did not. And in fact, I never need these people.
(4:33:08) And they're not even that skilled. I can't move them into a different role. This is one of the hard things about hard things about business, which is you have to make the decisions to say, "Okay, if this person is not an all-star A player and I'm not going to need this role, and there's no other role that they fit into, or maybe there is, but they're not an A player and they're not the right person." You have to make the hard call of saying, "Okay, I have to exit this person from the business." Now, here's where most people
(4:33:32) go wrong is that they think that exiting some from someone from the business needs to feel crappy every time. Okay, so we talked about this literally the other day. We said, "How do you Okay, because we talk about uh in hospitality, for example, they talk about you want to have a very like um excited hello and a memorable goodbye.
(4:33:49) " And I'm like, "How can I create a memorable goodbye when I have to let somebody go?" Seriously. I'm like, well, you know, I had somebody about four months ago that I had to let go because of a behavior problem, but I liked this person. I actually didn't want to let the person go, but they violated our code of ethics, and I said, "Well, I don't really have a choice.
(4:34:07) " And so, what did I do to make it feel good? I had no obligation to give that person severance, but I said, "No, I would like to give them five month severance." Why? Because I felt like that was the right way. And you know what? That person was actually surprised and was like, "I can't believe you're giving me this much severance.
(4:34:24) " And even though they were like, "I'm upset." They weren't that upset because they were like, "Wow, I'm gonna find a job in two months and I'm set up for five months of severance." And so when you make those decisions, you have to think like, and some people might be like, "I don't have the cash. I don't listen.
(4:34:43) Me and Alex, I remember when we had to let somebody go and we only had $20,000 and we were going to have to pay this person $15,000 in severance." And I did it because I was like, "This is the right thing to do and I don't want to tarnish my reputation." And so I would say like in general you're going to have to confront these things. The reason that people don't the reason people quit in business is not because they can't figure out how to make something work.
(4:35:01) It's because they don't know how to manage their emotions around these very hard decisions. But the thing is is like think about it like this. This is going to keep happening. And so you got to figure it out now because then you'll have it figured out for the future. And this is us setting ourselves up for future success. Would you add anything to that? Uh no.
(4:35:18) I think you hit the nail on the head. There's the By the way, Leila's right. This is business and it's going to happen. Uh we have done it. We're going to do it again and it's very normal. The first thing is you have already figured out that you are probably overstaffed in this department. Good on you. Congratulations. The sooner you figured out the better.
(4:35:35) Now let me give you kind of like a framework for how to think about all of this. You figured out today that the current state is overhired. Awesome. Right now we have to figure out okay what is the future state that you want where you feel like it is not overhyped where it's actually right? What is that goldilock state? Right? that Goldilock state, you're better off designing it not with people, but with boxes. So, let me explain. We talk about boxes, not people.
(4:35:58) When you're stuck with something, you get stuck in the emotion of, man, I can't let Leila go. I can't let Chiron go. And then you get stuck with the emotion of letting that person go. That's not what it is. You're doing something right for the business. Your current state does not work. You understood it. Great.
(4:36:10) What does your future state look like? Your future state looks like this new set of boxes. Okay, great. Now you say from my current state who are the people that will match those boxes. Cool. Now you've made that plan. Now there's some kind of transition plan involved. And we call this you need to separate the decision from the communication.
(4:36:28) We've decided that the current state or the future state looks like this. The decision has been made. Now the communication is a little sensitive. Hey, do I let Sally go today? Do I let her go later? Uh do I need her for a few projects? Do I not? Can I set her up with something else? Can I retrain her on something else? Now the communication is a different strategy. So a lot of people get stuck with the decision and the communication being one.
(4:36:46) I would offer that it's very hard to you have to separate those two. So think current state, think future state. Separate decision and communication probably a little easier. Such a good frame. Yeah. Decision and communication. You guys got to take that one because a lot of you don't make decisions because you immediately think about the communication.
(4:37:03) Let's think about somebody on here and you've got a boyfriend or you've got a girlfriend and you're like, you know what? I don't even like them anymore. I watched your content. And now I'm like, they got to go out the door. But then you're like, you stop because you think about that 10-minute conversation that you have to have with them where you break up.
(4:37:23) And you allow that 10-minute conversation to be why you stay with somebody for two more freaking years. It's the same with hiring and keeping people. Most people have the wrong people on their team, not because they haven't made the decision, but because they don't want to have the communication, and they just avoid it profusely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good question, Ed. It's gonna happen to all of us.
(4:37:45) Longest pee of my life. You know what I'm saying? Go ahead. That's interesting. So, hi Mike from what to do on a date. Love this. We teach dating and social skills to high earning men. Our target customer works in either tech or finance. 35 to 55. Biggest fears are rejection and not knowing what to say.
(4:38:12) What are some hook ideas to grab their attention? Oh my god, I shouldn't have read that one. Okay. How do I grab the attention of a man 35 to 55? Am I the avatar here? Am I the avatar here? I feel like Yeah. What would grab your attention if you were single and scared of rejection? Well, to lower the stakes for me, too. Right. Say, because I'm like, "Hey, I'm busy.
(4:38:42) I'm working. What if she doesn't like me? I've tried this before. It's really awkward. Do I show Do I show up and say that how do I show up and talk about myself? Is in this case, I'm assuming it's a lady, but is she independent that she's not going to want me? Is this a gold digger? I don't know." Right? And so, I'm just trying to I want to I want to lower the stakes for myself, too.
(4:39:05) So, if there's some way where it's casual, be like, "Hey, I get to know somebody." Like, I don't know. This is a tough one. Yeah. What's a hook that would grab attention? Feel like, "Where's Alex when you need him?" How to not feel awkward. No. Um, how to get No. I was on the internet when that was okay. This is This is how you know this is real when and not AI or or presscripted, guys. I don't write hooks.
(4:39:34) Um well he I will give you I'll give you a suggestion without giving you an answer. So when while Leila is thinking when you're in a tight spot right we have the gift of AI these days and I think it's really really important where you can the you know I think Mike shared with us here he started giving us a good sense of a clear avatar right now if you can get a really deep sense of who your avatar is and you can actually feed that into AI and you can say hey assume you are this person trying to meet this person what are your let I give you a framework for this. What are your fears? What are your frustrations? What are
(4:40:10) your wants? And what are your aspirations? That's what you want to write hooks about. You want to write your hooks about fears, frustrations, wants, and aspirations. So when you give your avatar to AI, you can say, "Hey, for this person 35 to 55, high earning man, uh works in tech or finance, is still single, is looking for, you know, looking for companionship or looking for a partner.
(4:40:35) What would be, you know, what would kind of what would be their fears? What would be their frustrations? what would be their wants? What would be their aspirations? And it'll give you the fears, frustrations, wants, and aspirations. Now, you can take the fears, frustrations, wants, and aspirations and start to build headlines and hooks around those. So, you're not just thinking, "Hey, let me build a hook for the avatar.
(4:40:52) " You're thinking, "Let me build a hook for the fear or for the frustration or the want or the aspiration." It'll allow you to play with it a little better. By the way, it doesn't matter if it's just that avatar. You should be doing this for all your avatars, regardless of who they are in any thousand%. The number one mistake successful men make that kills attraction instantly.
(4:41:05) Well, see that's why rejection hurts more for high achievers than how to beat it. You can close million-dollar deals, but you freeze when talking to a woman. My goodness, dude. That's so good. Savage. When in doubt, smart and business, clueless in dating. I said answer these like Leila Hormosi. It's my uh it's your AI. Yeah, it's my I've built my own AI with all my company information in it.
(4:41:31) But but while this is a a little sidebar, I will also tell you we use the same process in our recruiting and hiring process, right? So if you're if you're hiring for a, you know, I'll make this up. If you're hiring an operator or or a COO in your business, like you we should ask, hey, what are their fears? What are their frustrations? What are their wants? What are their aspirations? What would they fear? What would they be frustrated by? A CEO is going to deeply be frustrated by you controlling everything that the COO does, right? And so that way you can write a job description associated with
(4:41:59) matching the fears, matching the frustrations, matching the wants, and matching the aspirations. You will write a significantly better description. You'll have a significantly better technical set of interview questions. But we should do we use the fear, frustrations, wants, aspirations framework a lot because it allows you a lot more empathy to put yourself in their shoes. Yeah.
(4:42:16) Sorry I couldn't come up with the hooks. I can see the comments. I'm not a man 35 to 55 dating women. Yeah. Hard to Okay, let's go here. Um, okay. Hold on, guys. All the free stuff comes on Tuesday. Just if you remember, Alex only said it 17 times, but I just want to repeat it again because I see the comments that I'm an Um, it comes on Tuesday. It will be delivered to your inbox. Promise you guys.
(4:42:43) The scroll's not working. All right, let's go. We're an accounting firm and just brought on our new CFO to lead our bookkeeping and advisory functions. What would you recommend as the most effective 90-day onboarding plan to ensure they're integrated quickly, drive value, and set the foundation for long-term success? I feel like you just kind of did this. Kind of did this.
(4:43:07) Yeah. Um I'll start and then maybe you have some perspective on it. So the whenever you bring folks into a deep finance function, you have to realize that um they are the one team that almost touches every team in some way.
(4:43:26) So if a if a finance leader does not have good relationships with the rest of the leaders in the company, it is going to be very very difficult. That's absolutely the number one thing that I would suggest. So, uh, your finance leader should come in and have really good kind of get to know you one-on- ones with everyone in the company. And then that conversation is related directly to, hey, what are your goals and how do you see that impacting the financials? Say, what are your goals in technology? How do you see that impacting financial? Say, what are your goals? That should be the question that they ask. So, that gives this finance
(4:43:49) leader some context. Second big thing, if anything that your finance leader can do is in their first 30 days, their entire job is to do one thing is to build a dashboard. Nothing else. If they can build a dashboard of everything that the leadership wants to see, then the next 60 and 90 days are entirely built on getting that dashboard to light up accordingly.
(4:44:13) Otherwise, you don't know what you're actually focused on or what's actually important because then at the end of those 90 days, you get one single dashboard that based on conversations has been the most important thing that is to be bubbled up. And then all the other work that's done is to fill out that dashboard and make that come to life. With that, you as the leader of the company are going to be like, "Wait a minute.
(4:44:31) This one thing alone, this one tool which is this interface to my entire finance department has been solved. You probably have so much more transparency and you get to make decisions better and your finance leader can be uh effective much better much faster. Those would be two things. Now I will tell you the third thing if you don't have a high performing CFO right now in the organization the one thing that is generally broken which we work work on a lot is probably money controls right and let me tell you about how money controls work.
(4:44:57) It's like, hey, um, Leila wants to wire money. Sure. Well, if there's no control on another approver on the money, then you have no idea. That stuff will break very quickly because someone can hack Leila's email. Anything can happen. So, money controls are really important. So, just controls are pitching and catching. Someone says something, some the other person wants to do something. You have two people approved. Anything that is money related.
(4:45:16) The thing that breaks in most organizations is you don't have money controls. when you don't have money controls uh you don't know you're you're you stay awake at night and kind of these bother you you know much late you get you get stressed because you you're not sure if someone's embezzling from you you're not sure if the right bill fell to the you know bottom of the pile etc so three things that I would have one have the right meetings with the right leaders so that everyone knows what their priorities are that connect with financials number two set up the
(4:45:40) dashboard so that everyone can kind of contribute to that and third make sure controls are in the right place it's really good let's see uh some questions there. This one's got uh turned off. What about for nail salons? Do you have any advice on how to scale? You know, nail salons is an interesting one because I happen to be a customer.
(4:46:04) Um and I think that the industry has definitely changed because of Instagram and Tik Tok. So, it used to be that you go to a nail salon and it's like, you know, just having acrylic nails, having gel nails was enough. Now you're looking at the best of the best always as inspiration on Instagram, on Tik Tok, on Pinterest. And so I've talked to a few different uh artists and salons about this.
(4:46:29) And here's what I've seen is that um the best nail salons that I have seen that were able to scale and actually have six to 10 to 15 locations, which guys is not many in a nail salon industry. There are so few. They're mostly owner operated. There are very few chains that are successful and actually make good profit. The two that I have seen, they did a couple things.
(4:46:49) One is that they had a very clear career path for people that were doing nails. So for the artists, they had a clear career path where essentially they had a tier almost like with sales, you've got, you know, the outbound callers, you've got the SDRs, you've got a junior sales rep, a senior sales rep, a VP, like you have the ascension.
(4:47:07) They had that for the nail artists. And so what it meant was that the more skill, the better they got at doing nails, the more money they made. That's the biggest thing. The reason why a lot of salons fail and a lot of artisticbased service companies fail, think tattoos, think hair, think anything that takes talent. You could even think injections. Um they fail because they don't know.
(4:47:30) They don't have a talent attraction retention machine. You are in the business of talent, my friend. You are not in the business of nails. And so the same goes for injections, the same goes for hair. You are all about finding and retaining talent. We do that a lot at acquisition.com because we are in the business of talent to make a lot of our stuff work.
(4:47:48) And so what I will tell you is this. You have to be able to present a better compensation package in some way for them. And pres when I say compensation package, um I'm talking about not just the growth of the career, but also all the things around that, right? And this is how I would be thinking about if I were you. I have to create a compensation package incentivizing enough that when they think I could just go start my own salon, I could do my own mobile business. Instead, they think it's just not worth it. I'm just making enough
(4:48:18) here and I've got enough growth. And like when they weigh it out, it it's just too close. So, you got to get close enough because you're not competing with another nail salon or a hair salon or an injection whatever. You're competing with the opportunity to do it on their own. Yeah.
(4:48:35) And so when you're in the talent business, you are not competing against another business. You're competing against their ability to go do this on their own. And that's what you have to remember. So good. Would you add anything there? No. So good. I think uh just to reiterate one thing that Ila said, if most people can't see a a path in which if they did good work that over time they can grow, they can make more money, they can have more success, then we have some we have an opportunity there. And so it's may that just be title, may that be status, may that be, you know,
(4:49:02) vesting of shares, may they be they make more on an hourly rate, maybe they they get a team, whatever it may be, it doesn't matter if if you're a flat organization, you have to end up rewarding people for showing up every day and doing good work day after day.
(4:49:19) And so if I believe that I could show up and do good work and the longer I stayed here and I would be better off, then I want to stay. And and so the the longer they stay there like, man, I've been here so long, it makes no sense for me to go out on my own and reset up all of this again. Oh my gosh, pain. It's so hard to do. So just give people a a growth path in in some way. And it always doesn't have to be monetary.
(4:49:37) Yeah, that's 100% true because a lot of them I mean I remember them saying like they're like, I didn't need to make I was talking to one of the artists um I talked to because I tried out like seven different nail artists before I picked mine.
(4:49:50) And I she's like, it's not like I have to make the same money I would make on my own. And she's like, "But I just need to know that if I put in more work, I made more money." Of course, that's all it's like. You want to get reward for your work. You're like, "I just want to know that I'm not stuck at this the rest of my life." Which I think a lot of people think.
(4:50:01) And I think I'm just going to actually talk through that for a second. Like uh guys, if you own a business, demeaning people working for you is the absolute worst thing right now that we can do. I think that uh work has gotten a really bad rap. Being an employee has gotten a really really bad rap. And a lot of people undervalue being on a team now.
(4:50:24) So, like as you guys are, you know, maybe you got the bundle, maybe you did the 6K, maybe you're doing the free, maybe you're just reading the book, like it's not just about the business, it's about the impact that you have through employing people, through creating a place where people can work. And like I say this a lot, but I'm like, let's make work cool again. Because the way that we do that is by being cool freaking bosses, guys.
(4:50:44) Like, if you guys build amazing businesses and you create amazing opportunities for people, we can change the way that people see entrepreneurs, business owners, etc. The reason that they get a bad rap is because they treat people poorly and then and then people generalize it to everybody else.
(4:51:02) And so it's like we have a responsibility to not just make our customers lives better, but make our teammates and our employees and our partners' lives better. There's a an concept, you've probably heard of this, um uh but John Mackey from he he started Whole Foods, he talked about how um it has to be a win-win winwinwin. And so it was like a win for the customer, a win for the employee, a win for the partners, a win for the investors, a win for the community. And if it wasn't a win for all of them, that they didn't move forward. And that is how I've approached
(4:51:29) acquisition.com is like, I have to make it a win for everybody. This book launch has to be a win for everybody. The advisory practice has to be a win for everybody. The portfolio, every company we take on has to be a win for everybody. And so as you guys approach your business, think about it in that aspect.
(4:51:48) If you're making decisions where somebody's losing, then you just haven't gotten creative enough. You haven't beat the idea up enough. I don't know if No, it's so good. Um I I'll tie it back to the money model for a second and the reason why Alex talks about this so much is I remember Alex in my first conversation like about this topic maybe five six years ago and I was explaining to him that the the term I came up with and he you know he he he shares this now which is businesses that are in the 1 to three million I call them like swamp of success right which is great like you are in the swamp and and the swamp is
(4:52:17) one but the most important part about that is you're not in the swamp you're in the swamp of success you're like I just made two three million and I'm stuck here for for a while. Now, the reason is that when you make that much money, what you what you actually take home, you don't have enough to hire an A player. So, let me give you the example around this.
(4:52:36) I I talked to Leila about this often, which is that your job is to pay a lot of money to hire A players. You have to let the A players because they're good run a really good business. You have a very lucrative business model. That is your job to set up a really lucrative business model. Then you take all the profits from the lucrative business model and you go hire more A players.
(4:52:53) Like that is the entire A player cycle, right? And the reason we get stuck is because we want to hire an A player and then they leave. Well, you're like, of course they left because you don't have a lucrative business model to pay them more money. So our job as owners, business owners, CEOs, leaders of companies is to set up a business model where you can make a lot of money. And that is what this all about.
(4:53:11) Like we're not the reason we are wanting to share this with the world is that we want you all to make more money. Yeah. So that you can have you can hire more A players and make work cool again. So that that is the main idea. So if you had a lot of free cash flow, you could do a lot with it like buying more time, getting better people, etc.
(4:53:29) So this is really important. So do something with it. Yeah. And it's actually interesting to say is like, you know, you guys, if you you buy the book, you get the bundle, you apply the playbooks, and you're like, "Wow, I'm making a lot of money now. This is cool.
(4:53:42) What do I do with this money?" Like really think about this. You know, the reason why does a business when it makes more money, what do you do next? you invest that money somewhere where you're going to get returns on that money. Now, where are you going to get return on that money? It's like you're probably going to get better returns putting your money into some aspect of your business if you've already had success by creating money in that business than you are by taking it and investing in some crazy ridiculous I don't even know. You guys are into so
(4:54:05) many things. I mean, Alex talking about NFTs and crypto. I don't touch that  Like real estate, you know, like that's great. But like in general, you guys, that's that's where you get the the opportunity. So like for acquisition.com, for example, you know, I tell people this a lot.
(4:54:23) I'm like, yeah, all we do is just make the money and then once we have a big pile of money, we say, "What can we buy to make our business bigger?" And you just do that over and over and over and over again. And so, um, that's how you build something big, that's how it compounds. And it's, uh, you know, I think a lot of people, they look at somebody in business and they think, gosh, what do they have that I don't have? And it's like all it is is that they're willing to take the bet over and over again. Think about this, right? How many of us, we take the bet when we first start the
(4:54:46) business. We say, you know, I'm going to take all my money. I'm going to bet it on my business. And then we never do it again. Then we just say, it should feed me for the rest of my life. I should only be taking from it. But your business is like a relationship. You have to nurture it.
(4:54:58) You have to give into you have to deposit into it if you want it to deposit back to you. And so it means taking the money and reinvesting into it so you can get more from it. And the cool thing is that if you reinvest enough and you have the right money model, you can create something that withstands the test of time and doesn't need you eventually.
(4:55:17) And so that you can then say, okay, now how do I want to give back in a bigger way? And that's what allows us to have a bigger impact on the world as entrepreneurs than anybody else. I mean, if you look at even, you know, I'm not going to get political, but like how a lot of the best politicians of all time, they started as business owners. And so there's just so much more that we can do.
(4:55:35) If we can master this, then it's like the sky's is the limit, guys. The skills that you master in business can apply to any other area of your life. I'm not even talking about money miles no more. We've just gone off the rail, unhinged at this point. Where's Alex? Uh Ila, your opinion on creating a personal growth challenge for couples in communication, if I collaborate with private therapists, how do I price the workshop if I want to create a model? So, so very tactical.
(4:56:00) Probably need a lot more context on that. Yeah, I would say in general if you're creating a course for couples on communication, I would probably avoid partnering with a therapist at first and instead just relay that idea to a therapist or to a practitioner and see if it's even something that they think is uh viable for the business.
(4:56:24) So, it's like you kind of want to beat up the idea before you go and try and do something, right? And so it's like anytime I have an idea for something in business, I'm like, "All right, I want to go bring this to people who would have tangible insight about it." So it's basically like find your target customers, your target partners, bring it to them, have them beat it up, and then tell you if they think it makes sense to do something like that.
(4:56:43) I will also say if you're relying on a partner to make a business work, then you have essentially two clients in the business, which is like you have your partner who becomes like a customer in a way and then you have your customer who's your customer. And so you from the get-go you have two people you serve.
(4:56:59) And so I think in general with that model what I would say is just take a step back and say who do I want my customer to be. Do I want it to be the practitioners or do I want it to be the customer? And then try just one of those paths before you try and partner to sell something to somebody else's customer because it's going to add a lot of complexity too soon.
(4:57:18) It's an example of that is um when we started our company Allen uh the first thing we did was we just went direct to the customer and then we did it long enough to say you know what I actually think it would be easier if we were able to do this to the agency owner who then gave it to the customer and then we made that jump after 10 months and then we said okay we we found out enough about it this works better and it worked out really well but if we had gone straight to that it wouldn't have worked because we wouldn't have figured out and gotten all the feedback from the customer first. So, I would say before you go serving two people, just try and serve one.
(4:57:47) So, good. Awesome. You gonna bring it home. All right. Papa Mosie. Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Mr. Alexi. Alexi. Thank you guys so much. Um, so I think so, first off, thank you guys. I uh I actually had to dry my shoe off a little bit so I could put it back on. But this is the original beer show.
(4:58:07) Um, and I uh I took a I had a I had a sandwich and uh and now I'm ready to rock and roll. So, um, what we're going to do is we're going to have, um, the team do a little H for Hormosi hotline. Uh, and so they're going to hand y'all's calls and so I think in the chat they're going to let you know how to do it.
(4:58:24) Um, but any questions you guys have, um, I will be here to answer them. Uh, about about the offer, about money models, about your business, anything. It's going to be open microiz hotline style. Should be lots of fun. And, um, hopefully this is exciting. This is kind of cool. I think it's kind of cool.
(4:58:43) Um, I mean, we kind of just broke a Guinness World Record and now we're just seeing if we can uh get to the third fastest selling book of all time, which would be neat. We're just, you know, JK is still the goat. I want to be clear. JK, you're you're you'll always be the goat no matter what. All right. Thank you. Okay.
(4:59:01) I need a chair and then we're good to go. Okay. Let's rock. So, do we have a do we have a little little telephone? action. Put this trash down there. No one needs water bottles. Okay. Hopefully you guys uh enjoyed this as much as we enjoyed putting on for you guys. It's been a wild day. I got up at uh I think 2:55 this morning. H they're grabbing the phone. They're grabbing the phone. Okay.
(4:59:29) Well, it up. So, uh I'll actually if you guys drop something in the chat, I'll just see if I can 16-year-old entrepreneur starting out. Uh just start doing something, man. That's I mean it's really it. Okay, here we go. We're gonna get uh some texted. We good? We live. Okay, great. Um those green guys cooked very well. Thank you. Back from the toilet.
(5:00:00) No, no, I didn't. I actually just ate lunch um because they were like, "You haven't eaten since, you know, this morning." Do live calls. That is the goal. Uh, I guess they uh, you know, I'll be I'm like you got this is uh, just you guys know like this is real time figuring it out. We had no idea that this would go um this well. You guys are awesome.
(5:00:19) Um, I'm actually looking forward to having another tall boy after this. I'll tell you that much. Uh, beyond that, Alex went to pound town. That's aggressive. Uh, 17-year-old entrepreneur in AI. Well, I'll say this. I'll bring up the Let's talk about the AI stuff really quickly.
(5:00:39) So in a world of AI, your general understanding of business is going to be important because you ultimately going to be the ones who has to dictate the strategy and the decision-m of the brand and the business that you make. And anybody who's actually used the AI things like they have a bias for uh agreement.
(5:00:57) And so if you say should I do this or that like it's I don't think the decision-m that is there is that is that high quality in my opinion. And I think that there's a very large opportunity uh to use them to a high degree primarily to do excuse me, do stuff rather than make your decisions for you. I think them informing decisions, I think, is a good idea.
(5:01:18) Uh but I think strategy, at least for the short term, uh you'll need a little bit more. And I mean, imagine getting to the end of your life and being like, I didn't make any of these decisions. The robot did. It's like, is it really your life anymore? I don't know when I think about that kind of stuff. Uh, that being said, uh, for those of you who did choose to to do the Super Bowler bonus, uh, which was on the thank you page, super excited to to have you guys and work for the next six months. Okay. I don't know the password to this phone, by the way.
(5:01:42) You want to just tell me what it is. All right, great. All right, ready for your call? Okay, Chloe, we're going. All right, Chloe, let's see how this goes. Let's see if the mic can even pick this up. All right. Hey, can you hear me, Uncle? Hey, Chloe.
(5:02:05) What's going on? Hey, it's so nice to to chat with you again. So, um, super excited. My coaching business operates through a webinar funnel, okay? And use affiliates to get people to the training. So, the coaching program is $2,497. Affiliates get $1,000 commission per enrolly. Okay? And then we have continuation offer of $2.49 49 a month or $2,490 a year. So $24.99 is the offer.
(5:02:34) You pay a,000 bucks in affiliate commissions, right? Yes. Okay, that's fine. Got that. And then um and then after the 249, it goes to what? 249 a month. Yeah. Okay.$249 a month. How long is the program? So the initial program is 12 weeks. The continuation offer is I mean either we hope to get them in at the annual price which they all have chosen um but people could do it at $2.
(5:02:59) 49 a month just monthly but most people do three grand a year. Yes. Okay. Got it. So this is 3k per year on the back end. Got it. So um what's the So do you pay any commissions on that? No. Okay. Got it. So what's the issue? Yeah. So on average our affiliates are generating 77,000 for us. And so my question is on which Uh, no. Per partnership. So when they partner with us, it's a onetime thing.
(5:03:23) Some of them have chosen to do it again. Got it. So my question is on which next money model step to prioritize. So it could either be a high ticket offer for the affiliates because a lot of them on our partnership calls are also asking me for coaching. Yeah. Or it could be to further increase the LTV for current coaching clients. No, I think that your I think where you'll get the most leverage.
(5:03:46) This is this is not a a money model thing. This is a strategy thing. Um is if you're you said you make $77,000 on average per affiliate that you do a partnership with, right? Yes. So I think the idea would be okay if we do $77,000 per affiliate partnership, how do we get them to do it four times a year or twice a year rather than just once and then never again? Right.
(5:04:09) So what's revenue right now and how many partnerships do you do a year? Yep. So we um this is actually thanks to the VAM days. We're just starting to scale this a bit more. So, we are hoping to do about 4 to eight webinars per month over the next 12 months and pack them up with 10 to 12 affiliates per webinar. Amazing.
(5:04:31) So, what's revenue then or what's it pacing right now? Right now, yeah, right now it's pacing at like 250K a month and we're hoping to get it at least double that in the next six months. Okay, got it. So the the long-term like what makes this business into something that's really attractive long term is that you build a base of affiliates because basically they become your distribution. And so then that becomes the most valuable part of your business.
(5:04:54) And so the idea is like okay I have access to this network of call it you know 200 affiliates and those affiliates on average do two times per year at you know 77k. Um and then that becomes a reliable because remember there's two ways you can have a business that continues to grow.
(5:05:12) You either have stuff that people never stop buying or you have people that never stop selling for you. And so this is a people never stop selling for you type model. And so it's like okay if every year you just keep adding 10 20 30 affiliates to the business um then the business will just keep continuing to compound as you know provided those affiliates can get leads etc.
(5:05:32) Right? And so that to me is like I would just be thinking this is like medium medium term. How do I reactivate as many of the affiliates as possible? And after every time they do a launch, how do I just immediately book them for the next one? So, it's like, great, that was awesome. Let's book you six or nine months from now. Uh, and let's get it going again because like, hey, why not do it twice a year? You get 150,000 a year just from doing this. That sounds like a pretty good deal.
(5:05:51) Amazing. Thank you. I appreciate that. No, you bet. That would be like that would be my first my first thing because if we can just retain them, it's like you're doing three or four, you know, affiliate launches a month or whatever. It's like, yeah, but you're every month you got to go and get other ones.
(5:06:04) It's like, let's let's build this this base of 50, 100, 200 affiliates and know that we're going to do 14 million twice a year from 200 affiliates. Yeah, that's how I'd approach it. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.
(5:06:24) Congrats again. Oh, thank you. It was a joint win. It was a team win. Thank you. I appreciate it. All right. Next up on Hermosi Hotline, here we go. Stephen. Hey, Stephen. Looks can be to Stephen. That's a Taylor Swift reference. I have I've listened to her. Oh, hello. This is Steve Scott. What's up, Steve Scott? How's it going? You're on Heroszi hotline. Well, hi. How are you guys? Good. Good. Tell me about the business.
(5:06:54) What's uh what's holding you back or what questions you got about money models or anything? Uh, sounds great. I um didn't expect to be on it so soon, but uh so right now it's scaling. Um I currently have uh a farm USDA certified two uh tea shops that is associated. So we grow herbs and we uh we blend for medicinal purpose. And so we have a kind of a line of uh organic herbs, herbal, you know, things that help you sleep or uh uh you know, digest, circulation, detoxing, you know, they're all kind of geared towards something specific.
(5:07:26) So you you have a farm, you sell supplements that are natural. Does that sound? Uh not supplements, herb herbal pure herbal blended tea. So we have a selection of white, green, black. Yeah. Yeah. I heard. Yes. You grow the stuff, you sell it. Okay. So what's uh what's revenue? What's the issue? Well, right now, um, you know, our revenue, we're probably, uh, 75,000 a year.
(5:07:55) Really new is a couple, we've only been in business a couple years now, so, you know, we're not really breaking 100,000 a year. And we're having a we're having trouble in this area. Um, you know, like I said, scaling. We sell locally. We have we're in a couple of we're at about five grocery stores right now. um couple of mom and pop uh restaurants, you know, things like that. So, we we bottle our tea as well.
(5:08:19) Uh no sugar, no caffeine or anything like that. Um really the the the issue is uh uh remaining profitable while we scale and we we were profitable slightly and then we've just, you know, we expanded. We do, you know, four or five markets a week. Yeah.
(5:08:40) As well. So, I mean, we're just hustling right now. Yeah. um trying to be able to uh uh yeah understand you want to make more pay for employees, right? So I think if you were like so you've got the bottles, right, that you brew it and then you you sell those. That's thing one. Uh then you've got the herbs and the tea. You sell leaves, right? Yeah. So we grow I mean we we uh we grow about uh say 30 different herbs that we blend with our proprietary uh you know recipes. So we have that line but we also source teas from Japan, China and Sri Lanka.
(5:09:09) So we have know those things as well but then we also bottle those herbal blends. So Stephen, I'm going to give you just a a general piece of advice that you may or may not listen to but will be the thing that will make your business grow. You need to do you needed fewer things. Fewer things. Absolutely. So like so I'm going to list out what you just said.
(5:09:26) So it's like you've got the the markets that you're going after, right? You've got you got those things that you're doing on a regular basis. You said you've got four or five groceries that you're consistently selling to. And I'm sure there's some relationship management that's, you know, has to go with that. Absolutely. And then you've got uh then you've got your bottle thing, right? You've got your bottling the tees, etc.
(5:09:42) Then you've got your buying, you're wholesaling other people's tees, right? And then on top of that, you have your own tees, uh, that you're, you know, drying and selling and blending with your own, you know, proprietary brands, etc., right? It's just like you're doing you're doing like five things and you're only generating $75,000 a year, which means that you're not doing any of them super well.
(5:10:07) And if cash flow is an issue, we need to get rid of the stuff that's uh hard on cash flow. So, I would get rid of the bottling right off the bat because that's like you're not going to scale with that until you have a tremendous amount more money. And so, what we need to do, I don't know if you were here on the on the launch earlier, but Tom Billy was talking about like when they were scaling Quest.
(5:10:23) The thing is is like retail is eventually where you're going to end up, but it's not necessarily where you're going to start. It's true. And so the idea would be to how can we generate as much brand demand as humanly possible such that these retail stores eventually even maybe locally start reaching back out to you saying, "Hey, people are coming to the store every day asking for your stuff.
(5:10:41) Now I'm willing to carry it because then you'll have more leverage and then you can ultimately, you know, price higher and then make more profit, right?" Yes. So I if I look at all this stuff, I'm going to guess that your proprietary blends are going to be the highest margin. Is that correct? Absolutely. And it's it's not even a Exactly. That's it. Right.
(5:10:57) So, if you've got the one thing that's proprietary to you and also aligned with the narrative, and that's the one that makes the most profit, then it's like great, this is a pretty easy decision. This is the thing that's unique, it has the story, and it makes the money. So, now I think what I would be looking at right now is how do I get people on Tik Tok shop and people are in that space to promote this stuff? And I would be selling straight e-commerce, straight to consumer because this is lighter. So, you can you can ship these herbs way faster and you can scale this thing to the moon. You don't have to be limited to wherever you're at. So no
(5:11:23) having said that I was somebody's reaching out currently and has pushed me to go on TikTok. So I am currently in the process of review and getting my products on you know on on Tik Tok itself. Um so no that that's where we're going as far as the the other things. I mean um the stores are just now reaching out to us.
(5:11:43) I mean that was the thing that happened this year instead of us calling and doing the you know they actually coming to us at this point. uh you know um we do it's one of those things we are doing too much it's three or four markets a week at minimum as well as the wholesale all that stuff right so let me just say the version of your business what we what we need to get to all right so we need to get to you doing te's you selling tees in proprietary blends and selling UGC via creators and ads that's it and then your next constraint is going to be you can't grow the stuff fast enough once you get
(5:12:13) there you can call back again thank you very much sir again. But that means that everything that I didn't say wasn't included, which means that wholesaling, you're going to have to wind down. I would, me personally, I wouldn't want to manage the relationship of the of the grocerers.
(5:12:30) I would rather kind of hold back because starting the wholesaling business is a whole another thing. You know what I mean? Like I just want the main thing, the TE's that you grow to be profitable and you sell them at a good margin. Build the brand behind that and then that's going to give you the leverage long term. Gotcha. And you know, I didn't even mention that we do bobas and matchas and things like that. It's a tea shop cafe. So, you know, it's a lot.
(5:12:49) So, yeah. Pick one. Go all in. Perfect. All right. Thanks, David. You bet. All right. Bye. All right. Heroszi hotline coming to a call near you. Gustavo Gus Lounge Bar. Let's go. You guys digging this? Hello. Hello. What's up, guys? How's it going, man? Excellent. Talk to me about the business, Gustavo's Lounge. All right.
(5:13:22) What's revenue? What's the problem? Well, so the revenue is kind of flat. Um, there's not really any returns. Well, what what's the number? What's revenue? Um, it's your first name. No one's going to know. It It'd be u zero zero return. No, no. Like, basically, you have a lounge, right? Yes, sir. Okay. But no, I don't care. Not not your returns. What's your revenue? What do you do in monthly sales? Oh, well, so it's about a,000 a month.
(5:13:52) How do you pay rent? Uh, I pay rent uh yearly. Okay. So, you're doing $1,000 a month. What's your rent? Yes, sir. The rent is about 2,500. Well, that's definitely less. Okay. So, $2,500 in rent. How long you been in this lease? I've been in it for about a year or so.
(5:14:18) So, you just paid your your second year just now? Yes, sir. Got it. Okay. How big is How many square feet you got? How much? I'm sorry. How many square feet? Oh, uh, it's about 300 square feet. Damn. Okay, got it. So, 300 feet. And what do you sell at this at this lounge? Do you sell hookas? Do you sell alcohol? Like what do you sell? So we sell alcohol.
(5:14:46) Um and then also kind of like some touch-up things for skin. I know it sounds like a little bit weird, but like Yeah, it does sound weird. Um some some uh some side things like some lotions and uh skin care products. Why? Um and then just because um well someone convince you a smaller community. Okay.
(5:15:15) And so it's more for people kind of um having to go on a walk or something like that, have a place to stop by and kind of chill out for a bit. I'm so confused. Okay. So how many people are in the local area that you live in? It'd be about 40 people in in the community that supporting. Wait, it's it's a very small community. Um Well, I mean, is this You got 40 people and you're trying to I mean Yes, sir. What do you want to have happen? All right.
(5:15:54) I I would like for it to just restabilize and um go on the up and up a little bit. Well, you only have 40 customers. You know them all, right? Um pretty much. Yeah. I mean, are you in the middle of nowhere or like is this like a commune? Like what is this? Uh yeah, it's a it's a commune um for a smaller city. It has a lot of people that come in and out traveling.
(5:16:23) So, you're a tourist city basically. Yeah. But then there's 40 locals. Yes, sir. And then how many tourists come through? Uh, on the average, I would say maybe 150 per week that go in and out of the town. Why did you start this business? because you're obviously not making money. So like why did you start it? To be honest, sir, it was to be able to help somebody else out so that they have a stable business license and to be able to um support their own family.
(5:17:07) Well, that's obviously not working, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's not when you have I mean it's like you're trying to make money in what what sounds like a very poor rural area that has 150 total human beings that walk through that are new every week. Yes, sir. That's tough, man. It is.
(5:17:33) It is. Um I guess I'm not even looking for that much money in return um just for some stability. I'm just like, why bother do this? Well, it would allow some travel opportunities for the person that runs it for me. Runs it for you. Yes, sir. Why don't you just have him like make YouTube videos and do it from wherever he wants? There's just so many other ways to make money that have superior like just that are just super like you are capped by the 40 locals and the 150 randos who walk through there.
(5:18:07) that like that's the cap and I don't know if like oh I just I feel like you should just do something else. There's so many other ways to make money. Basically you're operating within the constraints of a system that are completely unnecessary. If the goal is how can I support this guy or help this person make money.
(5:18:25) It's like just plug into the internet. Plug into the internet. You go wherever you want. Like you're limited by 150 people in your local area. So just like don't limit yourself to them. Just go to the other three billion people on the internet and you can do that any day of the week. I see.
(5:18:50) So would it be worth investing in some advertisements for this business or No. No. No. There's Dude, there's 40 people. You know them all. You just text them. There's no advertising. You just text the people. You're like, "Hello, come by." But like I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying though. I don't think this is worth pursuing. I see you have $2,500 a month in rent, right? So, if you wanted to run a 50% margin business, assuming your your your your buddy is going to be running this now, $2,500 a month in profit is I'm I'm guessing it's super low that your what your targets are here. Yeah, it is. Right. So, 25 So, he's got to make a hundred bucks a day. So, 3,000 like 100
(5:19:20) bucks a day profit. So, let's just double that and say with the cost of the business, whatever it's he's got to make $200 a day. All right. So, $200 a day, 30 days. But he's not going to work. I'm getting the vibe that this guy's not going to work seven days a week, right? Yeah. No, it's more five days a week.
(5:19:39) Yeah. Okay. So, we got 24 days that we got to make $250 a day now in gross revenue. And so, you basically have to have, you know, I don't know what you charge, but like I'm guessing it's not a lot for alcohol and stuff. So like basically I want to challenge the premise of the question which is that like this is not a game you should is there's some games that aren't worth playing. I'm going to take this to the natural extreme to explain the point.
(5:20:06) If I said I live on the top of Mount Everest. Now that's a destination. Let's go to something random. I live in in the in just a random I I live in the middle of nowhere. Truly I live in the Sahara Desert. Okay. I have a lounge in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
(5:20:28) What should I do to grow my lounge in the middle of the Sahara Desert? I guess uh you're right. It I guess the best option would be to move location. No, the best option is not to move locations. Best option is to do a different business. Unless you want to go to New York and like compete with the club, you know what I mean? Like go to somewhere where there's people like if you want to have a local business, go where people are.
(5:20:48) I see. And if if people aren't there and you want to have this remote lifestyle, whatever, then plug into the internet. You can do that wherever you want. And if your buddy and and I'll say this, this is just me to you. All right? So, taking your buddy outside of it, maybe he's right next to you.
(5:21:00) Who knows? You're not responsible for this person at some point because it sounds like this person's an adult. At some point, they got to take their own like they got they got to man up or woman up. Like they got they got to work. They got to figure this out for themselves. Like you're you're hanging your own life back.
(5:21:20) All right. So, yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna dip, but like these are these are your action steps. You need to not take responsibility for someone else's life who's an adult. And you need to switch opportunity vehicles into something that can actually make the amount of money that is required.
(5:21:38) And that guy or gal can learn how to do that in like not long. This is like you you have internet where you're at? Yes, I do. Yeah. So, then they can find out what to do on the internet. really easy. Okay. Learn one skill and then message people about it or post content about it. It's all you can do. That's all you have to do. Very simple. Okay. Cool.
(5:22:02) Well, that that is very helpful advice actually. I think I will be um cutting my losses then. Well, good, man. It's not a loss if you it's not a loss if you move forward faster. All right. All right. All right. Appreciate you guys. Yep. Appreciate you, man. Keep doing what you're doing. You, too, man. All right.
(5:22:23) See you. All right. Now, we're going to Luke, 21 years old. All right, Luke. Let's dance. Let's dance, Luke. Hello, this is Luke. Salutations, Luke. Greetings. Is this Alex Herozi? You're on the Herozi hotline. What's the business? How much you making? What's the problem? Yes, sir. So, this is the timber garage. It's a handmade table company here in Ohio. We're doing 5 500k topline, 30% IBIDA.
(5:22:50) Oh, I love that. And basically we're doing uh 10 to one um LTV to CAC. So pretty healthy numbers there. Great. Um but basically my my question is when we're building super high-end products and you know manu manufacturing them ourselves oftent times these are products that people keep in their homes for you know 20 30 years.
(5:23:10) How do you create recurring revenue or you know make them buy multiple times? warranties, annual maintenance, and then the accessories. Okay. And I offer I offer a lifetime warranty currently. Should I make that an upsell? Correct.
(5:23:30) And gifts that they can give their friends because their friends are going to have holidays on a regular basis. Okay. Can could you give me a quick example of that? So you I'm sure you do wood stuff, right? Yes. So some sort of theme that's similar to that that they can give to their friends would be something that I would consider as like the accessories, things that they can like, oh that that bowl is so cute that you put on this top of your coffee table.
(5:23:48) It's like, oh, we can give it as a gift. But I mean the if I had to do one thing, it would just be uh warranties would be the upsell and maintenance. Those are the two. Okay, gotcha. And so then um as as far as those small gifts, what price point do you come in at that? Do you make it something that's fairly high ticket like our AOBS right around 5K or do you make it those small things like a bowl or a cutting board like you just mentioned? I mean you can still make them expensive. I would probably be looking at stuff that's like 10 to 20% of the
(5:24:11) price but like 90% plus margins. Gotcha. Okay. And then based off of what I'm telling you right now, is there anything else that you you see I'm missing as an opportunity? No. I mean I think you just need more, right? You just need to sell more. You need more more more advertising. Yeah. This is an advertising thing. if people are really happy with it and they get good reviews. This is just a pure Yeah.
(5:24:34) It's a pure brand and advertising thing. And then the issue that's going to come up next after that is going to be your supply of like how how many of these tables can you make? And at that point, you're going to have one decision to make, which is like, do I want to start going high-end and go to 15, you know, 15 $25,000 tables or do I want to start, you know, machining this so I can sell even more? Gotcha. Okay. Awesome. That that sounds amazing. I'll absolutely implement that immediately. Rock and roll, Luke. Appreciate you.
(5:24:58) Thank you, Alex. No, you bet, man. Congrats on the business. Really good. Thank you, sir. All right. Well, I can't wait to see the table. Thank you. Take care. You, too, man. That was good. That was good. You had good business. All right. Now, I got to remember what this passcode was. Let's see if I can remember it. Nice. Nailed it. Still got it.
(5:25:18) Still got Amanda Watti or Wadey. Amanda Wadey. Amanda Wadey. All right, Amanda. Let's rock. You guys dig a little homey hotline? Hello, Amanda speaking. Hello, Alex speaking. How are you? I'm great. How are you, Alex? Excellent. Tell me about the business. What's the problem? Yeah, so I was kind of put in a very unique situation about two months ago when the workplace I was working for decided to close their doors. Okay.
(5:25:49) We had lots of customers who loved what they were doing and wanted to keep going, okay? But didn't have anywhere to go and they decided to close. So, I decided to start up my own business. Uhhuh. And basically I run offmarket Thank you. Basically I run offmarket deal sourcing campaigns for um M&A professionals via cold email outbound marketing. Yeah. Sorry, I was just swapping. I had to stop at a bench here and talk to you.
(5:26:13) No, that's great. Okay, so you're finding deals, you're sourcing deals, and then you get what? A finder fee? Basically, I run 2K a month uh per campaign per client and I have several clients right now. I know I can only scale this to a certain point with just having me here and I've got a lot of things automated.
(5:26:34) So, okay, I can probably scale it to about 30k 30 to 50k a month just myself. So, each of them pays you $2,000 a month. Is that correct? Sorry. They each pay you $2,000 a month. Yeah. Okay. So, they all pay to Got it. And I can probably do about 15 to 20 clients roughly by myself before needing to hire on more people. How many you got now? Uh right now I've got about three.
(5:26:58) Most of the people that wanted to sign up are holding off till September just because M&A summer is slow. So you have three. I'm probably going to double that next month. So you have three and then you're going to get to six. Six to 10 next month. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Okay. Cool. So you'll be at, you know, 12 or more, right? 12 plus K a month. Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Fantastic. All right.
(5:27:22) So what is the uh what is the question here? That sounds like a decent plan. So my question is, as I'm growing a business, I'm kind of curious if I should continue to focus on the campaigns that I know run well, do well, or should I look for some sort of upsell to capitalize on the existing clients that I already have? Um, or should I be focusing more on, you know, referrals to private equity groups, things like that? I've already got about 200 million in businesses that are in my pipeline right now that are potentially ready to sell um that I've sourced personally that I'm connecting with private equity groups
(5:27:51) about. So, I'm already doing that. I think you're just your money model's off. I think you're just make you're you're monetizing the wrong way. Like you you give a very valuable service if you really do indeed source deals for M&A. Yeah. $2,000 a month, $24,000 a year.
(5:28:07) And especially if they're taking off like some months, skipping months, like call it 20,000 a year is what is what you're you know, net net per customer. That feels really low for what you're doing. You know, if I'm going to write uh, you know, if you source me, you know, four deals and I pay you $24,000 for it, that's like insane. Yeah, exactly. It's just a lot of the time I find the people who are jumping on these sorts of offers tend to be the um like they're looking for minimum a million dollars in IBIDA, but you're looking at some of the smaller firms like you know, Sunell, Transorld, you
(5:28:39) know, that sort of stuff. heard. Yeah, I got you. I mean, I would still look at like uh what what's the average deal size? Uh like I said, minimum 1 million. No, I know they're even, but what's the average transaction clients are looking? Uh most of the times the revenues of the businesses are about 5 to 20 million.
(5:28:56) Okay, let me ask it differently. What check do they write to buy the businesses that you source them? Sometimes it depends on the industries just because of the uh Give me an average. Give me an average. I'd say most businesses are being purchased between 15 to 30 mil. Okay, got it. Yeah, you're way underpriced. I think you got to be looking at 1% acquisition fees or more.
(5:29:22) So, I would char I would charge the exactly we're charging and charge an acquisition fee. I like we're 24,000 a year paid annually upfront and we get, you know, 1% of the uh and the way you write the contract, by the way, is you do it on the enterprise value, not on the cash value of the deal.
(5:29:41) So, because the way that the way that it's going to work is they'll do like let's say it's a $10 million deal for simple math. So, you have a $10 million deal and they're not they're not going to write they typically won't write a you know a $10 million check if it's a million dollar deal. They'll say you know we're going to put you know you're going to seller finance 20% you're going to do an earnout for another 20 and then you know 60 will pay you in cash, right? Something like that. And so you want to get paid on 10 not on six.
(5:30:05) I do that for private equity groups and you know family offices and that sort of stuff but for brokers I just do the flat fee. So for private equity groups I charge the retainer of the 2k a month plus I charge uh success fee on a lemon's scale. Okay. Why would you not do that for the other guys? They tend to just say no to uh any sort of success based fee. It's either one or the other. Either a success based fee or a monthly fee.
(5:30:29) Um most of the time it's a flatout no from Yeah. I think I think you just need to go up market. Okay. Yeah. I mean like if you you provide a valuable service and you're selling partially to broke people and partially to rich people, sell to rich people. Mhm. I mean that's that it's the same work for you to source a $100 million deal as it is to source a $10 million deal. Sometimes easier.
(5:30:52) Oh, exactly. Yeah. I mean it's the same proven formula on the back end for me. It doesn't make a difference of the targeting. It's kind of what I charge people up front. Exactly. So that's so if that's the work that's required then like screw the other ones just source the big deals. Okay.
(5:31:10) In the short term because I am a new business you know this is my main income. Should I keep a base amount of clients to keep my monthly income coming in based on the setup I have right now and then work on moving up market like you're talking about do all my marketing all my advertising would be getting private equity and saying this is the this is the new way we do things. Yes. Okay.
(5:31:27) Cool. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. I appreciate. No. You bet. Congratulations on the business. Very cool. Thank you. All right, rock and roll. Okay, so I'm going to take I think I'm going to take two more. All right, and then I'm going to Nick. Let's see here. Nick. So Nick is 800K revenue, profit is 40K.
(5:31:55) I'll take two more and then I'm closing this guy. Nick, Alex, what's up, man? Records. What was that? Congratulations on the world record. Oh, thank you. Tell me about your business, man. What's uh what's revenue year to date? $413,000 and we're at $43,000 profit. Okay, so 10% margins. So 400ishk top line, 43k bottom line. Okay.
(5:32:30) What's uh what's the business? So, we do accent walls uh uh feature walls in people's houses and we're split 50/50. Residential and commercial. Our residential clients, we have twice as many and average uh job orders half the price. So, that's that's one question is uh how do I decide where to focus residential versus commercial? So, it's a pretty classic situation that you're in.
(5:32:58) I would say instead of thinking about where to focus, I would be like, where do I focus my advertising? So, you want to focus the advertising on the place that you're going to get the most leverage, which is gonna be the people who pay you the most. So, basically, what's the difference between LTV to CAC on each of those two types of businesses or types of customers, excuse me. Um, LTV is better on commercial clients because they come back. Residential customers heard what's CAC on either of those.
(5:33:21) Um, I I don't have clear numbers on that. Okay. How much more work is it to get a commercial versus residential? It's probably twice as much work. Okay. How much more are they worth to you? And on average, they're they're worth double. Okay. So, it's twice the work and they're worth double, but they also come back. Yeah.
(5:33:44) Right. So, all of your effort should go towards commercial because that'll build a recurring base of business for you. And basically as soon as you can get 70ish, you know, basically if you can cover all your all your costs and I do think you're probably mispriced, too, because your your margins are bad.
(5:34:01) Um, I'll do, you know, we deal that deal with that on another call, but I'll say right now, if you just want to listen to me blindly, um, just raise your prices by 20% at minimum, okay? Across the board. Your margins are too slim. One one other question. I started a school group because I I also like teaching for carpenters. They're just starting out. Um, which is really fun, but then my focus is split. So, yeah.
(5:34:25) Is that okay to be doing both or should I just do one? No, you need to focus, man. I would say if you want to if you want to if you want to have a community, have it be for your customers, right? And then maybe they'll buy more stuff because you're in touch with them. It's a long-term lead nurture. Yeah. Keep push push the customer.
(5:34:42) Keep them hot, baby. Keep them hot. Okay. Okay. Okay. 20% price raise. Switch your community to your customers. Focus all your marketing on commercial because that's recurring. And to make sure that's recurring, actually put them into a sequence to get them to come back. Amazing. Cool. Rock and roll. Appreciate you. All right. You too. See you. Wasn't that fun? That was a fun one.
(5:35:07) Uh I love simple things. Let's go. Uh all right, Christian, you're up. If you're watching on the live stream, you're up, man. Yo, what's good, man? It's Christian. What's cooking, Christian? Talk to me. So, my name is Christian Willard. I'm 23 years old. Two years ago, I was homeless.
(5:35:30) Had zero dollars sleeping in my truck. Cool. I am uh I do residential concrete. I just started my franchise. We're going to be doing a million dollars this year in revenue. Amazing, man. Congratulations. Launch the franchise. Thanks, man. Amazing. Okay, so talk to me. So, you're doing a million dollars this year. Is what you're saying? That's your pacing? Yeah. Yes, sir.
(5:35:48) And so the franchise, are you the franchiseer or franchisee? I'm the franchiseer. We just uh paid the franchise company a ton of money in there. Going through all the documents right now, the FTD. Got it. Okay, cool. All right. So, but your $1 million, is that coming from the franchiseor or your one location? One location, Morville, North Carolina. Heard. Okay.
(5:36:07) What are margins on your uh on the concrete business? 25 30%. Okay, got it. So, 250 I'll just say 250-ish K. Is that including owner pay or no? Uh yeah, that's that's uh that's just turnkey. It's pretty pretty low. No, including is that 250 what you make plus the profit of the business or is that that's turnkey? Turn key. So, okay. So, with a manager heard. Okay.
(5:36:30) Understood. Understood. Okay. Got it. So, um how can I help you? Um to be honest, man, uh this is kind of taking a step into franchising. So, I mean, um you know, we don't we don't have a lot of overhead. We pretty plain on overhead. It's just going to material and self split.
(5:36:48) Why don't I just give you some advice? Yeah, I'll just success like let me just give you advice. Okay, so here's the thing. If you if you pull this out on a long enough time horizon and the only thing that's going to make a franchise successful is it franchises. Literally nothing else matters. Yes, sir. And the way to do that there's there's a couple things.
(5:37:05) So number one is that you're going to succeed based on the quality of the franchises. And so as much as you're going to want to sell and you know chase fast growth revenue or whatever, you want to keep the bar for your franchisee as high as humanly possible because how good they are is going to be how good your franchise is and your unit economics in terms of average revenue per per location is going to be one of the main things that makes this thing tradable and sellable in the long term and the thing that's going to get better franchises in the future to come and want to buy it. So your first like 10 20 franchises, you have to be like these guys can can kill
(5:37:36) anything. Like you have to find studs who are going to do this. So it's absolutely a two-way thing. As much as somebody can look look hopeless and you're going to want to have the franchise fee and all this stuff and take the cash up front, resist the urge because those 10 are going to be the ones who give you the averages. They're going to learn a bunch of stuff with you.
(5:37:52) You're going to want to be you would really want to see them as partners, not customers. All right, so that's thing one is picking high quality franchises. The second thing is do not get do not get um distracted by many different revenue streams with the franchise. Don't try and complicate it.
(5:38:13) If you have a model right now that works, just make the thing better. And by being better, usually it means how can I remove complexity? How can I automate things that don't require extra people? Like it's it's those things that can improve the model rather than like we're going to start adding this service and this service and this service in because then people just die from a thousand paper cuts of lack of um lack of focus.
(5:38:32) Yes, sir. 100%. Yeah, we'll keep it pretty simple. I appreciate your your advice, man. You bet. And then from a from a long-term perspective, how are you planning on getting the franchises? Um, it's actually going to be probably through my Instagram brand and then I would actually was going to actually go and vacation to other cities and like go to Andy's list and hire fake estimates and just kind of like pitch him there on the spot to be honest. That's kind of my idea how I was going to get him. I mean, I don't think it's a terrible idea. Um,
(5:39:02) yeah, I think it's a good place to start. Again, it's like you want winners. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's what you're going to have to look for. The tough part is that if you're finding somebody who's like struggling and then wants to convert over to your thing, it's like they might just not be winners.
(5:39:20) So, something to be mindful of is like maybe you take 10 of these pitches, maybe five of them want to buy, maybe you just say yes to one. Okay. I mean, I'm I'm not opposed like it's not to me like, you know, from being homeless to, you know, I'm at now like it I'm not I'm not money hungry. I'm about you know, building a brand.
(5:39:39) Um, I I turn money away all the time, you know, when it comes on to like people wanting to to join in and do these things, you know, like you said, being picky, man. And I'm I'm 100% with you on it, man. Well, I appreciate that. And I think that your your customers and franchises will appreciate that, too. Um, keep the bar super high. Don't over complicate the model. Don't be in a rush to scale.
(5:39:57) And at the end of the day, uh, I said the only thing that might be beneficial for you is, well, I don't want to get ahead. Just do those two things. That's the main thing. Just do those two things first. Get to call it 20 20 to 30 locations open and then I think at that point you'll have enough cash flow to sustain bringing on a more experienced exec who's done. Ideally, you want someone who's had one big success.
(5:40:23) He's he's he or she is hungry and wants to do it big um with another one. So, it's like they get one set of reps from somebody else. they were in charge of it, but they didn't get as much, you know, skin in the game. You know, give a few points of equity uh that they have to earn with a one-year cliff so that like you don't give it away too soon or anything like that so that they can drive the sales and then you can you can run the overall org. Yes, sir.
(5:40:45) Dude, I greatly appreciate this. This is going to one day you'll see it, man. And uh it'll be awesome. Well, I look forward to it. Congratulations, man. It's a great story. Thank you, man. Shout out to Jesus, my hot wife, and my awesome son. Well, I love it, man. All right. See you. This is great. All right, let's go. Meand, that was fun. I'm going to do another one. That was funny.
(5:41:15) Okay, let's do one more. All right, by the way, as soon as I hang up this call, we're um I think we've been going how long we going since since nine. Oh, 9 to5. Okay, little eight hour shift. Hello. Hello, Miland. Salam, Alex. How are you? What's up, man? Talk to me. What's the business? What's the problem? So, I'm a I do email marketing for e-commerce companies.
(5:41:42) Um, main business model and the main issue at the moment was just I was miscalculating my CAC to LTV mainly. Yeah. So, our business model was we would do a one-time like email automation setup for e-commerce companies and then try to upsell them on the recurring. Okay. But I was doing that model wrong in the beginning where I would, you know, I would sell them on the one time, but I would get so hungry on trying to sign more clients where I wasn't focus on the recurring. Uhhuh.
(5:42:12) So now basically like so far this year we've done I believe 450,000 and only the profits are around 10%. Okay. So Okay. How are you getting customers right now? Right now Yeah. Facebook ads. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This it's not going to work unless you keep customers. This model doesn't work. I'm just telling you right now.
(5:42:30) So what's the what's the recurring thing that you're selling? So we're selling recurring like email campaigns. So we do, you know, like the email blast, all that sort of stuff. Oh, email blast or you mean like your your nurturing leads like, you know, you set up and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, we set up Clavio to Shopify and we do like segmentation, all that. Yeah. Yeah. Heard. Okay, got it.
(5:42:50) And you do turn key like you write all the emails and you send it for their, you know, for their stuff. Yeah. I have my team do it. So we have like a team of copyriters and designers. I get But that's what you do as a business. Exactly. All right. What's the price point? So our typical price point right now like average across all of our we have like 13 active clients.
(5:43:08) Okay. Average is around 2k per month and it ranges like it ranges between 15 to like 2500. Okay. So 2k a month. So you're doing 26kish a month and then you have your front end sales which gets you to get you to 40ish. Right. Exactly. Yeah. All right. What are you charging on the front end? Front end for our flow setup we're doing uh 29.50. Okay.
(5:43:33) So 3k on the front and then how many of these you selling a month? So, um, I was doing this offer for around like a few months or probably around like eight months and we were selling on average anywhere between 12 to 16. I had to stop it. Yeah. Interesting. What's it cost to acquire a customer with CAC? My CAC for this entire offer from here, I'm pulling up the numbers right now from October all the way up until when I stopped it was around average 2400.
(5:44:00) Yeah. Yes. You break even on the front. Exactly. But then you're not doing any but you're not really converting people in the back. So what percentage people from offer one? All right. Why don't we just do this, man? So why don't you just say, "Hey, uh, I can do this thing for $10,000 upfront.
(5:44:20) This whole automation, right? You hearing me?" Yeah. or I'll include the $10,000 for free if you become a customer, which you can do today for $3,000 a month. So, you're saying do the upfront offer is 10K and then lead them into the recurring. Well, it's an anchor. So, this is called bonus continuity, by the way, everyone who's watching one of the money models.
(5:44:50) So they come in, you say, "Hey, I've got this thing that I do, which is you whatever the initial automation setup, right? You say, "So it costs 10 grand to do that, but if you want us to set it up so that we can do the recurring on the back end, we can do that as well. Um, and I'll I'll wave the 10K.
(5:45:08) I'll include it and I'll build it for free as long as you commit to six months." Interesting. So Oh, okay. So have that as like a Gotcha. So you position that as like, okay, we're just going to do that for you anyway. You have to commit to six months on like a 3k a month because that's what I'm trying to increase the price to. Yeah.
(5:45:27) What if I want to cancel a month four? What do I What do you do? Um typically we just let we just don't do any um long-term contracts or anything like that. We just typically just do months to month. Right. So hear me out. Now that you have this offer, what do you think you're going to do? Probably if they're if they have to stick to it after if they're trying to leave after four months, then probably Not sure. I mean, let him, I guess. I don't know. So, when you say the 10K, this is what you do. You say, "Hey, it's $10,000.
(5:45:58) I'm willing to stomach the $10,000 if you'll commit to six months. If you want to cancel between now and the six months, you just pay me the $10,000 that you would have paid if you wanted to be monthtomonth." Gotcha. So, it's canceling to go to the full like just 10k. So, think about it like this. It's $10,000 and then $3,000 a month monthto monthth or it's zero and then $3,000 for six months and the $0 is the $10,000 thing.
(5:46:29) But if you cancel the six months, then you got to pay me what you would have paid for the flexibility being monthtomonth. That's the trade. So if I have to front the risk, fine. I'll like I'll front the risk if you make the commitment.
(5:46:42) But if you if you redeg on the commitment, then you got to pay me what you were going to pay me originally to have the flexibility. Okay, that makes sense. And then, okay, no, that that makes total sense. So then rather than just selling 3K packages, doing that, trying to get a result for them, and then upselling them, your cash flow is going to be the same though.
(5:46:59) Your cash flow is going to be the same though because you're charging 3K right now, you're charging 3K with the other thing. Same same. Yeah. Right. Makes total sense, right? Except this way, a every once in a while, somebody is just going to say yes to the 10K, and those will be nice pops when you get them. And the 3K per month on the back end is still 50% higher than you're currently making.
(5:47:16) and you're currently making 10% margins, which would take your uh your margins from like 10 to if you just did the exact same number of customers you currently are, uh that would add 200,000. Um it would take your margins to 35%. Yeah, that'd be amazing, right? Let's do that then. Yeah, that's very Let's do that. Totally. Sorry, I have one more question just because the way that I'm positioning it right now is like, okay, we'll build this, you know, 22 email setup for, you know, onetime payment. Well, I wouldn't say a 22 email setup. That sounds very commoditized. But yeah, go ahead.
(5:47:46) For the actual offer side, when I'm trying to like actually write in front of the ads, all that sort of stuff, would it just be like we'll build this crazy automation setup for free and then or is that like a bait and switch? Like basic how would you position on the front end? Well, what are you saying now? Well, right now this is the ad that we basically is working the best is like we'll do this 22 email flow setup for onetime payment. That's fine. Run the exact same thing. Just pitch this instead of what you're pitching right
(5:48:15) now. Gotcha. So, just pitch the bigger setup for the 110. Okay. Gotcha. And then 10K. Okay. Right. Gotcha. Okay. That makes total sense. Appreciate it. Bingo. Bango. Money. Mango. All right. Rock and roll. Appreciate you. You bet. All right. See you. Donate a book. All right. Donate some goddamn books.
(5:48:41) All right, Peter insurance. All right, Peter insurance. All circus are busy. Please call again later. Oh, Peter's busy. Peter's busy. Peter. Peter Insurance. You missed it, man. All right. Danny Dance Studio. That is kind of funny. Um, Danny Dance Studio. I hope it's called Danny Dance. Danny Dances. Good afternoon. This is Danny.
(5:49:14) Danny is What is the name of your dance studio? Uh Movers and Shakers. Uh it's not Danny Danny Dances. No. I thought it'd be funny. Okay. This is Alex. All right. Talk to me. Oh my goodness. What's the business? What's revenue? What's revenue? Where do you want to be? What's the problem? All right. 650K.
(5:49:32) Great. Uh I believe the constraint is myself with sales. We need a good salesperson and I don't know how to pay a great salesperson enough to stick with us. We only have a couple leads come in a day and this has been the constraint I think for a long time. Okay. So, yeah, Peter's trying to call back now. Too late. Sorry. There's a there's a call busy signal, but you're the priority, Danny. All right.
(5:49:59) So, 650,000. You said you're the constraint being sales. Now, tell me more about that. Does that mean that you can't grow the business because you're in sales all day or because no one else can sell like you? I think they can sell like me. I just don't know how to afford them. So the cost of a program is about $500 is maybe maybe 800.
(5:50:21) Yeah, that's the problem, dude. That's the problem. Like you got to fix the business right now. Like we don't want to scale this. The business doesn't like What are your margins right now? Uh about 50%. Interesting. I just like I still feel like you could make even more because if if you're charging 500 up front and 800's LTV, it's like you're not really converting anyone.
(5:50:44) It's like you're one time popping people. How are you getting customers? Ads. Uh we don't run any ads. It's all inbound. It's all inbound, but people just buy one set of dance sessions and then that's it. About 50% uh renewing. And then after that, what happens? Some will renew longer, some will leave and come back. Some are gone forever. I'd love to bring it up to 70%. I'm definitely not sure how to do that yet.
(5:51:08) Why don't you get them into a membership? Uh, we recently experimented with selling more programs up front with very limited success so far, but I'm open to it. No, no. Like, no. Like, sell your front end thing because you're obviously closing on that, but I'm saying why don't you just take the 500 and then just roll it into a membership.
(5:51:26) Yeah. They go through levels. So, they start beginner, then intermediate, then just roll it. Yeah. rolling to the next level. So like when they purchase the first level, uh well they before they finish the first level, offer them the next level and then credit their first level towards their second level and price the second level such that when you roll in the first level to the second level, you still make a good profit.
(5:51:49) We do I mean we uh sell it about halfway through the first level and we're at about 50% recurring. And then what percentage of people from the second ling buy the third thing? About 50%. Yeah. So you got to keep Is this And these are what? Six week things. Uh 10 weeks. 10 weeks. Yeah.
(5:52:12) Are you the dancer? Uh I used to teach everything. Now we have a couple other instructors. I came to your scaling workshop last summer, by the way. Best program I've done in my entire life. But Oh, I'm glad. I appreciate that. You donate some books? I already purchased the 200 books. Yeah. Rock and roll. Appreciate you.
(5:52:32) Okay, so The margins are good, actually. Did you Did you ask me a question at the workshop? Because I feel like I remember a d a dancer. Yeah. Yeah. You have really good margins. I remember this. Okay. So, you had really good margins. Um Okay. So, just subtracting direct expenses. I mean, it's about 80% margins, but when you take away the overhead, right about 50.
(5:52:50) Yeah. I mean, well, yeah. I mean, without overhead, I have 100% margins. Um Okay. So, why can't you I just like I want this to be more recurring. That's the thing. Like this is the thing that bothers me about the business. I'm glad you're making money. I'm glad it's 50% margin. All this like all this stuff's great.
(5:53:13) It's just like it h like it just I mean obviously I understand the space really well, right? The reason So I did you see Rick on here earlier? I did not. Okay. So Rick owns a franchise that does um that does that does small group training for gyms. It's one of the best franchises right now in the fitness space.
(5:53:30) And the key that makes his model work is that they have a 38-month stick rate. And the way that happens is because they do semi-private. So oneon-one four, one on six. And then people get to know each other and they have a regular calendar that they're used to. They take this as their main workout. Um, and so the key is we have to figure out like how do we get basically the thing to solve for this business.
(5:53:49) If you really want to solve like really actually want to do this business for real, all of your effort has to go to how do I get people to stay for more than a year. Okay, if you solve that, you crack the whole business open, LTV is going to expand. The problem that you have is like, yeah, you can't pay sales people because like there's there's just like there's not there's not really a ton left. That being said, you're running 50% margin.
(5:54:06) So, like if you had $325,000 a year in profit, which is what you're making right now, could you pay $100,000 salesperson to sell for you? Yeah, for sure. So, I don't know why. Like, I mean, yeah, for sure. It's a six figure sales job. You'd sell 250 left and then with all the extra time, you could go make more money.
(5:54:23) What what kind of commission would I be able to offer them on a back into it? Back into it. Back into it. So, how many deals uh per per year or whatever? Just do per month. How many deals per month do you uh would a sales guy be expected to close? I mean, we only have a couple leads coming in a day. So, 20 30. Okay. So, a deal a day, call it.
(5:54:43) That is what they can close. Okay. So, if you He's got to make two grand a week, right? So, he's working five days a week, I'm guessing. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, he's got to make $400 a day, 5 days a week. Okay. So, something doesn't make sense with your math, though. Yeah.
(5:55:12) Because if you're closing 30 deals a month, and you said LTV was 800, then that would mean that you'd be doing uh $24,000 a month, which should put you at 300,000 a year, not 650. I know what it is. A lot of people purchase without um reaching out first. They just purchase online. Yeah. Yeah. These are people who reach out. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Um okay. So, you're doing a deal a day, but the average ticket is 800. LTV is 800. Yeah.
(5:55:38) Maybe we need to just start advertising and suffer and take the loss for a while to get more lead volume and then we could actually pay them a Well, I mean, if you advertise well, you'll make more money. you be like, I have to suffer at advertising. Like, if you do it right, you'll just make you'll make a bunch of money. Um, okay.
(5:55:56) So, if I really wanted to fix this business, you have option one is you can just run ads, right? That's that's an easy option. But I would not want you to do that. If we really want to do this, right? You want to fix LTV. Like, if you want this business to really scale, if you want to get to like millions of dollars a year, not just a few hundred thousand.
(5:56:13) And I want to be clear, what's your goal? Like do you just want to make this? Um yeah, I mean if we expand it to you know two three million a year that'd be great. All good. Okay. Well, if you fix the model it'll just keep growing. That's the thing. So we just have to fix we have to basically I would look at how you're doing your delivery and think how can I do it in such a way that people can get enough and like maybe have a $500 front end but maybe there's a maybe there's a $1,500 front end and that has a better a better client ratio. So and then they're stickier too. I don't know.
(5:56:43) But right now the the the thing to solve is how do you get people to stay for three years? One year to start, but ideally three years with personal training. How long would be realistic for a person to stay? 38 months. That's what I'm saying. 38 months. Okay. Yeah. So you want teaching? Yeah. Churn under 3%. That's what you want. 3% teaching a skill.
(5:57:06) The thing is once they have the skill, I believe it becomes a lot tougher to to keep them around, you know. Yeah. heard. Well, they learn new songs and then I'm sure they dance with one another, right? And they have and like and I'm sure like everything it's like if somebody said, "Hey, Alex taught me how to sell, right? It's how well, you know what I mean? Like there's there's le like there's depth to skill.
(5:57:32) It's not like, okay, he can do the chaa, but it's like how well can he do? Is he cha champ or he's just decent at the chaa?" I'm just making this up. I have no idea. But like like I imagine that maybe part of it is just like your own belief of like well they already learned It's like, but how but how how good are they? Okay.
(5:57:51) My experience is that at the higher levels it becomes much more competitive and even harder to keep them around. Yeah. I understand that that would crack the code though. I mean that would make a huge difference. Yeah. Well, maybe Okay, hear me out. Is there a way that you go from teaching to like to like a group some sort of larger group setup that's like more scalable so that becomes like the recurring bucket that's like fun and maybe lower priced but people like never want to cancel because it's almost like a dance club. Yeah. Yeah. People do run dance clubs.
(5:58:20) Uh it feels like a whole other animal and not necessarily desirable. Yeah. Well then, dude, if you don't want it, if you don't want it, man, then then then that's not the that's not like the thing is is if I say, "Hey, if you start advertising, the business can double or triple.
(5:58:39) " But the thing is is like that lever only gets pulled once, right? And so I'd rather fix the bucket before we pour a bunch of water. Pouring the water is almost a commoditized thing. Like we run ads, people come in, we sell them, but then it's like, okay, then the whole game is just, you know, I buy customers at 200, I make 800 with, you know, 90% gross margins or whatever it is.
(5:58:56) And it's like, so you're just buying, you know, $400 bills or $500 bills for $200. Not a bad thing to do, don't get me wrong with it. But like, if you want to build the asset, the business, it's like, how can we how can we keep those dollars continuing to come and really expand LTV because that's what's going to give you the stability for the business, which is what you ultimately want.
(5:59:13) We got to nail it first and then scale it. And then scale it. Yeah. No, but that's that's so I think when you go through the um the the lifetime value playbook and you go through the retention playbook, that'll give you a bunch of different frameworks to think through in terms of how to apply it. And obviously you can ask the HQAI.
(5:59:29) It'll give you a bunch of different frameworks to to to apply to your specific dance business. And then that might be the thing that will unlock uh the LTV for the model such that you can then fix it. churn goes down, renewals go from 50% to say 80 or 90% from cohort to cohort. Now you're now you're singing and dancing dancing.
(5:59:51) Start with start with the LTV playbook. Start with the retention playbook. The constraint is not the sales. The constraint you're saying is LTV. Yes. Okay. Well, I guess that's my homework. Bingo. Bango. Rock and roll. Appreciate you. Appreciate you, man. Thank you. All right. See you. All right. Okay. Who do you guys want? I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a name. You guys can tell me in here. All right.
(6:00:16) Would you guys rather have Would you guys rather have Do you want to call Peter back from insurance? Option one. He did call back. Uh option two is you can go with Ray Han tellaalth. $6 million a year. Uh or option three, we can go Kaden. All right, Kaden. It is. All right, I'll get I'll hit Peter next. I see some Peters in there. All right, this is Kaden.
(6:00:54) What's up, Kaden? Is this Alex? It is indeed. Hit me. What's uh You're doing what? 48 million in revenue. That's what I saw in the in the message. Yes, sir. So, we're pacing for 48 million this year. Badass, man. We're about Yes, sir. We're up 60% year-over-year. Congrats. What do you sell? I hit Creative Home Engineering.
(6:01:13) So, Murphy Doors, Murphy Beds, Hideway Safes. Oh, cool. Yeah. Money printing. Um, average ticket. Average ticket. So, we just added a sales team about 15 15 months ago. We were doing about $2,200 as our average. We're now doing 28 with the sales team. So, averaging between the two, we're looking about 2,600 as Really? So, you're doing a ton of volume. Yeah.
(6:01:38) About 20 21,000 uh orders per year. Badass. Okay. So, is this uh what's what's acquisition system? Do doortodoor or is it uh phone sales? So, ironically, for the first 12 years, we didn't have a sales team. It was customer service, but it was direct e-commerce. So, we've we've been very lucky. Um Wow. Okay. So, you sell these. So, wait, hold on.
(6:02:03) So, you were selling these units and then just shipping them straight out, correct? Yep. Got it. Okay. Okay. What percentage is e-commerce versus uh sales team? So, sales team's done 12 million this year. We're at 22 million as of right now. Um and then we've got other channels. So, we're about we're we're just about 48% from the sales team.
(6:02:32) uh direct to consumer and what when you say direct to consumer are they just dialing smiling and dialing or you just doing lead genen or like are you like no just just through marketing channels they're they're checking out direct through our website so they're they're landing our landing page uh they're following us on Instagram and over time they're they're checking out on their own so 48% uh 52% is is doing that we've got about 4% through Home Depot, Amazon Wayfare other channels.
(6:02:58) Yeah. Um, so, so my my question, my problem, my my burning problem that uh that I need solved is, you know, we've we've partnered with Grant Cardone. We're we're trying to get in with you as well. And and uh you buy some books, scale this thing. We we bought 215 books. So, yes, sir. Well, I appreciate that. All right. Absolutely.
(6:03:22) Well, and I thank you for the other 200 entrepreneurs who are going to get books. So, thank you from them, too. All right. So, uh, what's the So, you have a burning question. You said you wanted to partner. Uh, what's the like what's holding you back right now? Uh, honestly, nothing. Nothing's holding us back right now. So, so we haven't been out to see. We've we've been with the Cardone team for for about a year now.
(6:03:44) They've done an awesome job for us. We love them. Obviously. Yeah. Things are doing great. We we um we we think that what we're doing organically is working great and we we want to see it through. Okay. So, by 2027, we've got a plan to reach 100 million. Awesome. And so, my question is, you know, with with your expertise, what what channel do you see? You know, I think we've got so much fire burning under us and so much ability. You know, we haven't tapped into doortodoor.
(6:04:16) I I just started a channel where we're actually meeting with the developers, the designers, the contractors, you know. So, I think that channel, the lifetime value of a contractor is so much greater than just a direct consumer. Yeah. So, so I don't know if we just need to blast that channel, you know.
(6:04:41) Currently, currently the majority of our builder leads are coming from we do one event per year. It's called the International Builder Show. Yeah. We got to Vegas, we spent about a million dollars on our booth. We always get, you know, show the booth of the year, so on and so forth. We're able to acquire about 6,000 leads, builders, designers, contractors. Amazing.
(6:05:03) And and so within the past two months, I'm really trying to build that team out. So far, it's working great. It's onethird of our sales team's revenue. So I I'm I'm you know without a proof of concept. I'm just trying to understand if this is the route that I need to put all resources in or if you know you're seeing something with your No. So let's let me let me just cut you off.
(6:05:28) So right now the thing that I would be most afraid of if I were you is splitting my attention. Okay. Because I like to ask the question like what stops you from doing 10 times more of the thing that's already working? What are what are your margins right now? Uh 48%. Dude, you I mean come on.
(6:05:45) Okay, so you got great margins growing fast. You've got the e-commerce channel self-s served that's working. That's uh 52% or 48%. Which one was it? 40 52. Right. The e e-commerce is 52, right? You got 52 and then you got 4% from other and then you got I guess the rest is sales team, right? Correct. Okay.
(6:06:06) And then sales team are working what channel? Sales team they're so they're mainly working all the lead leads that are coming through all of our our from e-commerce. So they're just working Yeah. They're just working the leads from all abandoned carts and all that. Abandoned carts. Yeah. Exactly. Okay.
(6:06:22) So this was basically so the sales team add-on is kind of a CRO thing. So it's basically like So the easiest way to think about it is um All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna draw and maybe you'll see this video. I don't know if you're watching this live or not, but for my people, can you give me an overhead cam? So, if we have a triangle and let's say that this represents the marketplace, if you are currently monetizing the top of that triangle, okay, that's let's say with this is this is your normal e-commerce whatever, right? When you add a sales
(6:06:53) team, what happens is you take this line of monetization and then you just pull it down and then you convert a higher percentage of the people that are in this triangle. Right? Okay. Now, the way to grow this is like you you can't you're like if you keep adding more salespeople, eventually you will run out of leads to call. Correct.
(6:07:13) Absolutely. Right. And so that was a one-time lever, a good lever, don't get me wrong, and one that will increase uh AOV. Well, really more EPCs than AOV, but like increase increase um earnings per click so that you can spend more on advertising, etc. Okay, rock and roll. And um what we want to do is we want to expand this triangle as the primary thing. That's what I'd be thinking of.
(6:07:44) So your current way of getting the customers in, are you running any ads at all? Yes. Okay. Plenty. Yeah. So my thought process would be, okay, now that we have enhanced our earnings per click, we can now reach significantly more uh we can basically we can buy way more media and I already have the infrastructure to do that and I already have the sales team and so then the business just becomes Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.
(6:08:07) Yeah. So the business just becomes I'm going to spend more money uh on the advertising and by doing that that will then feed the sales team which I can then bolster up and so it just becomes this back and forth ping-pong between get more leads for e-commerce, hire more sales people, get more leads for e-commerce, get more salespeople.
(6:08:28) And that to me is a simpler setup for for me to say, "Hey, let's also do this other thing." Unless you have a a star who can actually run it without you doing it. Then I would rather you stick with the thing and double down on what is working most because like I'll say this differently. If you can double the business right with doing one thing, I think I would rather do that than double it doing four.
(6:08:56) Got it? So then let's just try and find the one thing and then put all of our emphasis on that. And right now you have a machine that's doing 48% margins growing 60% a year. I'm not like let's just add distraction because most businesses die from indigestion not starvation. They die from doing too much not too little. Absolutely.
(6:09:12) And rather I'll say too many rather than too much. Too much you can pretty much never do. Too many you absolutely can do. Got it. All right. That's what that would be without knowing anything about the team with zero context from a eight and a half minute call. That's how I would see it.
(6:09:31) Obviously, your bigger business, you're you know this, you will know your business better than I can right now. But that is the framework that I'd be using to approach it. The sales team was a one-time pull, increased my made more money, probably dramatically increased margins, all that's good stuff, but in order to really expand the business because to me, the business didn't really expand. You just better monetize, which is nothing wrong with that.
(6:09:49) Absolutely right. But now it's like you have top offunnel issues. So, we either have to like either you need to spend more on the existing channel and see how can I get to 250 million a year just by 5xing my front end. Uh or like if I really feel like I'd cap that, which you're I don't think you're even close. Um then I would say, okay, let's see if I can start another channel.
(6:10:11) But I'm going to always try and do more before I try and do new. Got it. Rock and roll. Yes, sir. I appreciate you, Alex. Appreciate you. Thank you for buying books. Absolutely. All right. See you, bud. All right, Peter. We're going to Peter. I got a lot of Peters. We're going to Peter. Okay, now I got to remember this thing.
(6:10:30) Hold on. Two. Hold on. What was this? Is this it? I got it. I got it. Still got it. Okay, Peter, you got to answer on this one. All right, Pete. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, Peter. Oh my. Alex, I almost I almost cried, man. I've been going to the workshop, man. I'm from Baltimore. No, I saw your area code. I saw your area code. All right.
(6:10:55) That's That's why I did it. That's why I called you back. All right. So, you're doing you're doing seven topline, right? Mhm. All right. You got two in profit. It's insurance. What kind of insurance? Yeah. So, we sell final expense. So, I need your help here. We sell to poor people. So, burial insurance, which is a really interesting model. Barrel.
(6:11:13) Burial insurance. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Okay. Got it. All right. So, what's the issue? What's holding you back? Yeah. So, um, we're kind of like at a crossroads right now. So, we I have built a large brand. I have about 60,000 insurance agents on my YouTube channel. 16? Um, 60,000. Oh, got it. Great.
(6:11:36) So, I get naturally about 20 to 30 people that want to work with us to to grow our team. Basically, we want to scale our team. So, our biggest problem is increasing our LTV um and our profitability. Right now, our options to expand, increase our LTV are to increase and go into a new product like Medicare, which is really highly compliant. Yeah.
(6:11:54) Or to offer insurance products, like we're an LOA call center, so we generate the leads, we pay salaries, and it's a small margin for our agents, but opening up the broker model basically as a licensing model where we can take them, they pay the fee, and then we can ultimately have them high contracts, but they take on all the risk.
(6:12:12) So, we don't know if we should just open that up to go from LOA, our call center model, to now a brokerage model or add an additional product like Medicare. So, so you said your margins are bad, but you're running 30% margins. So, like Yeah. Um, how would I say insurance is is tough. It's a it's a battle. We pay for all of our agents chargebacks. Yeah. So, they have no risk.
(6:12:30) So, it's like you have to keep selling new products to keep up with the chargebacks because when you're selling to poor people, as you know, it's a lot of returns. you know, they can't afford 60 bucks. Uh we're bootstrapping this business. We have, you know, a healthy savings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's uh we're at a we're at a tough spot right now.
(6:12:48) Well, I think selling a better product or more affluent customer is a good idea. I don't really love I mean, like I'm not going to make you feel bad. Um but like, you know, if you're getting a ton of chargebacks, like that kind of sucks, you know what I mean? Um like it's not a good way to live, you know what I mean? Like I mean you can make a buck but like make make enough to go legit. You know what I mean? Yeah. All right. So would you Mhm. So I I do like a a superior product.
(6:13:16) Um and you obviously know how to market and sell, right? It seems like you have that skill set. So you just got to sell better stuff, man. Better stuff to better people. You have a you have a good base skill set. You know how to recruit. You know how to hire. You know how to train. You know how to market.
(6:13:26) You know how to sell. You got a lot of the right tools. I think you just got to build a better business with those tools that you got. Okay. Build a better business. So would you just find a different product to sell insurance? We know how to Okay. And would you still build into like keeping the LOA? Because there is that we get the the long-term value which is the residual play a little bit, but it just been the products screwing us up. Yeah. But the residuals aren't worth much because the people cancel so quick.
(6:13:51) Yeah. So if you built if you started for two years, would you just say, "Hey guys, like prepare the team to change the product." No, it's it's you're in a tough spot, but like yeah, it takes I mean sometime I mean like listen like I want to be upfront. You're making money. All right, so I don't I don't want you like you know I don't want you to burn your building down.
(6:14:10) But the main thing is like it really depends on your goals. Like either you have to like if you can figure out a way to improve the service or improve the expectations such that people stop charging back, this could be a business that's better. And so like if we think about which problem would you rather solve, right? So problem one is I can try and improve the way that my people sell, how they're being pre-framed on the call via the nurture, the marketing, all the messaging that they're seeing prior to the prior to the phone call, right? And then whatever their experience is post call, there's some automation, some AI can put in so that I can retain these people and increase
(6:14:39) their LTV. If if I can do that, that's that's one solution set to fix the business. The other solution set is to enter another business which fundamentally like even though it's insurance, it's a total you already know this, it's a completely different ballgame, right? Yeah.
(6:14:56) different avatar, different acquisition uh process, different sales process, all of these pieces, right? So, I hesitate a little bit to say like go, you know, go change everything. I'd rather you see if you could fix the existing thing because you already have it down. Like, it's just like can we just fill the two holes that are breaking this rather than like really overhauling the whole thing.
(6:15:15) But I do think if we're looking at a 10-year time horizon rather than a two-year time horizon, you'll probably be better served with the better better customers, higher ticket Okay. Gotcha. So expand that way. It's almost like Chiron, he had that brokerage model we didn't take into. Like we have the people, but our model doesn't attract a players because it's like a call center like L.
(6:15:33) Yeah. I mean, you're selling to broke people. It sucks. Like I mean like you're like a collections company like 50%. Yeah. It's brutal. Well, yeah. It's it's tough. Lot of problems. So change the you think by change the product you also can change um you know ultimately who you recruit because there's obviously a thousand% a thou because like no one wants to be some no one wants to sell this. No one wants to buy it.
(6:15:57) No one wants to sell it, right? Yeah. We can't and we can't control the product cost because it's like 60 bucks and have a lot of agent retention problems too from the product. Yes. Of course it is. They I mean think about it like you deal with absolutely terrible people and so everything sucks. Everything stems from there. It's terrible people, terrible product, terrible employee. Like a whole thing sucks.
(6:16:19) Yeah. Yeah. So, so we just have to fix that. Well, yeah. I appreciate it. We're trying to think about adding the product, but it's just it's the people and it's it's painful these last, of course. Two and a half years. But, but did you learn you learned a ton of skills and now you just get to apply them to a better opportunity. Nothing wrong with that.
(6:16:36) Nothing wrong with that. Dude, you learned. How old are you? 26. We've been Dude, you're fine. Yeah, you're fine, dude. Dude, 26 in from Baltimore. That's right, man. That's right. Yeah. Um, no. So, I think I I would go I would go with the higher ticket, better insurance. The only So, the the skill that you're going to need to learn, you really only have to learn one right now.
(6:16:54) The skill that you're going to need to learn is you're going to have to learn how to advertise to hire socioeconomic people. And I mean, to be fair, just not bottom feeders. So, have to you don't have to, you know, advertise ballers. You have to advertise normal people, right? Middle class. Yep. Okay. It's all like one call close.
(6:17:13) It's like all we're doing is chasing that next sale. Of course I know it's it's hard on the guys man. You just need to take this monster front end. Maybe you expect that it's going to be a two call clos or a three call close. Okay. But if LTV is 10x, you can attract way better closers.
(6:17:31) They'll stay longer and there's also more models that are available to you like a brokerage, etc. Which is a legit, you know, it's a big, you know, big boy Yeah. And those things exist for 15, you know, 15x, 12x, sometimes 20x uh multiples on premiums. Yeah. Super big. Real enterprise value. Absolutely. That's the plan. Thank you, man. From the bottom of heart, thanks for calling back.
(6:17:51) Be able to sleep at night. We'll see you see you in two weeks at the workshop. Oh, rock and roll, man. I appreciate you. All right, buddy. All right. Thank you. Bye. All right, let's go. Let's go. Go, Peter. All right, let's see what else we got. Um, Kristen Plumbing. All right, Kristen Plumbing. Let's go. Kristen Plumbing if you're watching this.
(6:18:18) Hello. Kristen Plumbing. Yes, this is Kristen Plumbing. This is Alex Hermosi Holland. Hello. How are you? Good. Tell me about Kristen Plumbing. What's revenue? What's the problem? Okay. So, the revenue is 1.2. Profit is 350. So, about 30% profit. All right. My husband and I own the plumbing business. Okay.
(6:18:45) Okay. And uh our key right now is employee retention. Okay. So he's he's the master plumber. And uh right now we have him and one other plumber. And so they're generating uh the 1.2. And so let me just give you a very quick backstory is um I I run all the office part of the business. He handles everything in the field. And so, got it. The problem with that said is employee retention, but okay, I'm a little bit neither of us are good in that area.
(6:19:21) Okay, I'm a I'm a little bit better, but my husband obviously should be the one actually doing all of that. So, my question is, how do we fix this problem? Do we hire someone to fill this role? When you say this role, when you say this role, what do you mean? Um, you're doing 1.2 headcounts. What? Five, six? Yes. Yes. Right. So, it's you and your husband and then how many guys you got in the field, you know, technicians, whatever.
(6:19:51) Uh I would Well, two plumbers including my husband and uh like one to three helpers depending on the project. Okay. So, like just vendors, contractors. Yeah. Well, and and uh W we have one full-time apprentice as a W2. So, then what's the retention issue? Are you actually having issues retaining people or you having issues finding people? We're having issues retaining people.
(6:20:16) We're we're averaging about less than six months we've gone through and this has been for the last 18 months. Okay. Why are they leaving? Uh because they don't like I I think I think it's they don't like how my husband manages them. Okay. He's he's very military straightforward. Do your job. Yeah.
(6:20:38) and you know we offer good benefits and all the all the good things but he he's not the like he's tough and he's not the guy who's going to like build the camaraderie. So we keep thinking can we bring in like a service manager who may who maybe can also do some plumbing and fill that role and be like the barrier between him and the guys my husband and the guys. Yeah.
(6:21:04) But Yeah. Yeah. So, what's your husband's name? His name is John. Is John with you? Um, no, but I could him. Well, you can walk that way and to keep me on speaker. So, okay. So, I mean, basically, let me I'll say it to you this way. John, not having the skill of being able to manage and lead people is going to cost you 150 185 a year.
(6:21:34) So the options are that he can learn to change his behavior in such a way that allows people that they don't hate working for you and you can make and you can save that money at the bottom line. Alternatively, you can say we're going to cut our pay in half and we're going to get somebody else who has that skill.
(6:21:54) Okay? I mean those are like fundamentally like said differently. The environment in which people are working needs to change. Either he will change or he needs to leave and then somebody else does the thing the right way. It will cost you more to bring somebody else in than for him to learn to the skill.
(6:22:13) But that's a that's a you call business-wise. Either choice works. One is obviously higher risk because you're increasing liability and and and and fixed costs. Right. So, what are my two main options? One, hire somebody. The service manager that we're just referencing, hire a service manager.
(6:22:36) Or option two, your husband learns to change his behavior in a way that doesn't make people feel icky. Okay. So, how did you come up with that number? How much it's costing us? That's just my guess. No, you said 350 is your total net right now. Yeah. So, if we had to hire a service manager, I would imagine they're going to make 150ish. Yeah, that's what I would assume. Okay. So, 350 becomes 200.
(6:23:02) So, 40% of what you make would go to the service manager, but they're only going to be managing an apprentice and one other guy. Well, then we would then actually be able We already have two additional trucks, so we don't have bodies in. Oh, because you can't staff them. Got it. But do you have do you have jobs? Yes, we have leave. Oh, well then done done. This isn't even a question. Not even a question. Service guy for sure. Cuz even like Yeah. Done.
(6:23:28) That that that that was the that was sealed the deal. Done. Not even question. So then the question is how do you find a service manager you can deal with your husband? It's still going to it's still going to ladder up to this. But I'll say I'll say something that maybe Leila, are you there? What? All right.
(6:23:49) You want to you want to hop in real quick? How do we deal with people not being able to deal with me? John. So John's here. He's He's hearing all All right, John. So here's the deal. So Kristen and John own a plumbing company. John's out in the field. They've got one additional plumber and an apprentice. They've got more deals than they can handle. They've got two empty trucks and they can't have bodies because they can't keep anyone because John's a hard ass. Yeah.
(6:24:08) So they either have to I mean my goal was like okay hire the service manager maybe take some of that off of John but then the service manager is still going to report to John or is going to report to you Kristen. So I was going to say how how would you this is a this is a pure people people and AI uh master class from Ila. Yeah. So I look at it like this.
(6:24:29) What's your husband's name again ma'am? John. John. John. John. So there's the business. Can you see what I'm drawing? Oh jeez. No. If you're not, go on YouTube. All right. So, like you're good. There's your business and then and then there's John and then the the bubble of your business. John doesn't come into that bubble. John stays in this bubble.
(6:24:54) This is how Ila manages Alex. And then John gets to be Santa Claus. And you get to be the Grinch. And I found that that works incredibly well. And uh yeah, I had a one of my first mentors who said she took the whole business and basically circled all the departments except marketing and said, "Alex, you you do the marketing and then Ila, you take the the rest of it." And by the way, the people still report to you, Ila.
(6:25:25) And that worked out well for us. Greatest moment of my life. So I'll tell you the story. So, we paid I think $50,000 for a day of consulting from like an operations person. And so, he said, "Hey, I want you guys to write on this whiteboard everything that occurs in this business.
(6:25:42) Like, what what are all the jobs and tasks that have to get done?" So, he writes down this whole whiteboard covered with stuff that Leila and I are both doing. And so, then he takes this marker and he circles everything like every single thing on the board minus marketing. And he's like, "This is all I was like, I love this guy. We should pay him double." And you know why this is good for you is think of all the skills you're going to acquire. Yeah, absolutely.
(6:26:02) And this this kind of aligns with our personalities. Oh, good. Yeah. So, like just lean into your strengths. Like if you're more of a people person and him being on the field makes problems, then you just do that. I mean, we talk about it openly with our team and it's always like, okay, and we even talk openly like Alex, you always have a project to work on because if you don't have a project, then you're going to want to come in and break And break and then people are going to get mad and quit as one does. I mean like there's no there's no shame in the game. No, for sure. I I'll John, just to make
(6:26:30) you feel a little better, I'm 0 for 11 on EA's and the and the common and the common thread between report to me now. And the common thread between me and the 11 of them is obviously them. So hilarious. No, but now the EA's all report to Leila because I am too difficult to deal with. Yeah.
(6:26:57) So I guess the question then like isn't that going to be confusing for the guys on the field? Not really. It depends if it's a technical thing or it's management. I think that's probably a key key differential like you want to explain the the difference between like well just because you get information from somebody doesn't mean you need to report to them.
(6:27:08) So you know if you look at like a racy matrix for example it's like who's responsible who's accountable who's consulted and who's informed. It's like they're going to consult with John and learn from him but that doesn't mean that they're accountable to him and that he's responsible for them.
(6:27:25) you're responsible for them and they're accountable to you, but they may get consulted by John and then he gets informed about how they're doing. It doesn't mean that they're going to report to him. So, you know, service manager is reporting to me. Yeah. So, for example, you know, in our business, so you know, Alex has a media team like technically they report to me, but they talk to him all the time, but they're not talking about how to grow the team, how to manage results, KPIs in, you know, infrastructure. They're talking to him about the media, the art.
(6:27:51) So that's the differentiator that you have to have the art. Okay. An artist. Okay. I think it'll work way better and you guys will be way happier if you have that because also like you want to have your own swim lanes and like know where you got to, you know, fit in and swim and just keep swimming. Yeah.
(6:28:13) John, wouldn't it be great if you didn't have anybody report to you and you could just like train them on how to do the stuff and then somebody else can manage their emotions and things? Yeah, that I mean the manage the emotions thing I think that hit it right on the the nail on the head for sure. It's a uh it's a difficult thing for me to do to manage men's emotions on a daily basis. I get it. I get it. Preaching preaching to the choir. All right. So, that that helped you guys out. Yes. Very much. Thank you so much.
(6:28:37) So, the action item is hire the service manager. That guy reports to you, Kristen. And then John, you're just basically the you you're lead technician, right? Like when they have the most complex issues, they don't know how to do something. You they call you, right? If the guys are like, "Hey, what do we think about this brand idea or what are we doing? What about this like this copy or this hook or this angle or this video or this whatever?" They're going to come to me to ask me about that. But if they're like, "Hey, I'm having a problem with Tommy." I'm like, "I don't know.
(6:29:02) That's not me. Not my problem." Well, they know not to talk to me about that. So, they just don't. But like that's the idea. And if you just remain scary, they just won't come to you eventually. That's the key. And another good one is that whenever they message you, just don't respond and eventually they stop. If you post them, they'll stop talking to you.
(6:29:20) That's the key. Oh, yes. That's awesome. I got you. I got you. Have clearly been where we are. It's like we know. Well, I appreciate you guys. Donate some books and uh and I can't wait to to hear how the business goes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you so much. Thank you guys. Appreciate you. All right, let's go.
(6:29:41) John Smith. That sounds like a fake name. What are we thinking? Adrian, 22-year-old girl. Yeah. I don't know. No. Thomas Cairo or John. Thomas Cairo. Okay. Thomas Cairo. How many more should we do? How many you want? Hello, this is Tom Pal. Thomas Cairo. Yeah. What's up? It's Alex Hotline. Hey, how's it going, man? Rocking and rolling. I'm here with Ila. Hi.
(6:30:22) Hey, Ila. Are you watching the live stream or are you just on the phone? I'm I have the live stream on iPad and I got my phone. Rock and roll, baby. All right. So, um business is what doing a million bucks a year. Um, well, last year we did uh 750, but I uh I worked with Alex's books, you know, and some chat GBT and got it to in the last two months 100,000 revenue. Well, I'll be I'll be amazing.
(6:30:48) Can't wait till you use the playbooks. You'll love them. Um, okay. So, so good return on the books then. So, uh, yeah, fantastic. Excited today because of all this. Oh, awesome, man. For everyone at home, I did not validate these earnings. This is just him self-reporting it. your results will vary.
(6:31:07) Uh that being said, not bad for a book regardless. Uh imagine 12 more that you get for free. You donate 200 books and have an AI trained on all the other notes. I'm I'm messing with you. Not really. You should go buy the book anyway. No, I'm trying to build my own Alex bot. You know, this will be much better. Okay.
(6:31:25) What's the limit? What's the constraint right now? What are you trying to do? You got to you got you grew from 750 to a million. Do you want to build new locations? Do you want to scale the existing? What do you want to do? uh scale the existing to then potentially more locations and step back. I uh it's just between me and an assistant and my front desk. Okay.
(6:31:46) Um and I got a intern and she's about to go um getting paid and we're trying to decide like what is a fair split. So I spoke with people in my industry and they're doing between 2575 and 3070. Um, so I stuck with that and then I was going to give her a 50/50 on uh product sales and um then uh 10% on growth of net in the future for the front desk girl. Uh no, for my new associate.
(6:32:14) Oh, like a like a but it's a it's a it's a Cairo, right? Yeah, Cairo. But we do like I don't know if you've heard of Softwave. It's a we got two of these $100,000 stem cell machines that could regenerate meniscus. Okay. um functional med. So, we do a lot of uh concussion work. Okay. Um and then I'm interviewing some nurse practitioners to do therapeutic peptides um like through like we're trying to make like a regenerative kind of program because I have a lot of high net worth people up in Bale, Colorado that Okay. You're in Veil. Yeah. Got it. Heard. Okay. What's the margin
(6:32:48) on your million? Um, well, this month it'll be probably 7075. Amazing. That's great. Okay. 75% margins and you increased it. I'm guessing all the stuff you got from my stuff just added straight to the bottom line. Yep. Uh, just one like my social I'm I'm learning and growing. My wife's uh photographer and does graphic design, so she's been doing that.
(6:33:13) We got four kids, so she tries to help when she can. How much how many more how many more people can you sell right now before you hit capacity in your facility? So, within the last 3 months with the intern, I booked her to 45% booked. Okay.
(6:33:32) I'm 100% and I've been that way for years and I'm trying to get her to, you know, 75 and then bring on another person, another Well, if you're actually How far out are you booked? I'm I'm only booked like I'm I'm booked two weeks out 70% but I could always take on 30. Okay. So the question is how much to compensate her to compensate her uh to kind of get her to stick long term because she's she's like all freaking out.
(6:33:58) Um that I originally started 50/50 but then I realized after running the numbers if she grosses 20k it leaves me with nothing just with Facebook ads course and equipment spend. Yeah. So you have to do everything off gross profit not off revenue. So number one. Okay. So all your calculations in terms of compensation have to be have to operate from gross profit.
(6:34:19) Is she is she a full-time employee or is she a contractor? She's going to be a W2 full time. Okay. Okay. So the issue is just like literally it's just compensation. That's all we need to answer here. Well, compensation. I I didn't want to bog you down, but I also got um I have my own supplement line that I'm going to expand with the I'm talking to some guys who used to work for Eli Lily with uh kind of making affordable peptides that aren't on the gray market and then trying to go take that more regional and then nationally. Why? And then what that?
(6:34:55) No. No. Just don't do it, dude. I can't even tell you. Like different game, man. I mean, like if you want to do it, do it and get rid of the office. Well, no. I wanted the office to kind of run itself and give this girl kind of like the power to kind of take over that location. You know, it was just a It's going to run itself. It's going to run itself. Yeah, it'll run itself for sure. You guys run this on your own.
(6:35:18) Yeah. Yeah. It'll It'll just It'll It autopilot, dude. It'll just like while you sleep. While you sleep, just cash flow. Passive income. No, I'm Well, with with four year four kids, I get up at like four o'clock every day to work out, do all the stuff I had to do. 10 hours with patients, being with the kids, and then work two more hours.
(6:35:36) And I'm like, how can I get more time? You know, my father-in-law is in the self- storage business, and I'm like, dude, he just flies around and collects checks. That's awesome. Yeah. I think the question is, he's also probably like 25 years ahead of you. But there's that more than that.
(6:35:55) 84, right? And you know what? When you're 84, I'll bet you this, you will also be able to drive around and cash checks and not have to wait till you're 84. I really mean that. you're comparing your like first chapter to like chapter, you know, 17. Um, anyways, so let's get down to like there's there's two there's two decisions we need to make.
(6:36:12) One is I I'll just say and Leila and I both kind of jumped on this trying to start the the the peptide thing. I do think there's an opportunity in peptides right now. So, I don't be I don't want to say that there's not. There is, but it's a business and it's a totally different business and it's going to take 110% of your attention. And so, if you're like, "Hey, I want to get time back." you're just going to be working just as much in that. Just to be clear.
(6:36:32) So, it's like, what problem are we solving? If it's like, I just generically want to make more money and work less, neither of your solutions are going to do that. If you figure it out. Yeah. Right. So, I think that if you want to bring this this gal in or and whatnot, like eventually the way to make the the Cairo system work is that you have an owner operator, which is the right way to think about it.
(6:36:57) Typically like we just back out of like our percentages. We never have strict percentages that we stick to. It's purely based on OT so on target earnings. So we look at what's the market price for somebody who's you know a way above average person. Call it 85th percentile. This is to be fair how we do business. Not everyone does it this way.
(6:37:16) We do it this way because we prefer to pay above market and get way better people and that almost always pays for it. Not almost it just pays for itself. So we look at 85%. Yeah. 85% uh above market OT and then reverse that into the actual expected level of delivery that she's going to do. So let's say that I'm just using simple math. The math is going to be completely wrong, but just understand the concept. So let's say that uh she does uh you know 10 back cracks a month.
(6:37:39) I know that's not what it is, but just again simple math. 10 back cracks a month. Uh if we want her to make $200,000 a year, right? Then we're gonna say you're gonna make 80k base and you're gonna get $1,000 per backtrack. And so that gets you to 200. So 80k plus 10 a month equals 120. 80 plus 120 you're at 200.
(6:38:02) So we just take the OT of 200 or whatever that number is and then back it in to what what level of activity she needs to do. What is she doing now? No, but I'm saying like that's that is the thinking process to reverse engineer it. Now, if she's going to run the whole thing, then you don't even need to be nearly as granular. You can just say you're going to get 10% of the profit.
(6:38:20) Yeah. The more complicated an incentive plan, the harder it is because you have to consistently update it and it's going to be a lot of back office work. Plus, it's if you look at the psychology behind incentive plans as well as pricing, the more simple it is, the less variables, the more people want to buy it or people want to take the offer to work for you because it's easy to understand and predict how much money you're going to make.
(6:38:45) People just want to know how to predict how much money they're going to make. If they have more than like two variables, it gets messy and then it's not easy to predict. So, I've just seen the simpler the better. I've even seen sometimes with positions like this that it works better to just give them a base profit share plus profit share and they come on with the understanding that you have to hit X targets to maintain your job rather than like okay you have to hit these targets to get this money to it's like okay well what I'm actually saying is that if you don't hit these targets I
(6:39:09) don't want to pay you so like we could also just do that. Yeah. So I think base plus call it 10 or 20% that should equal out to whatever the ontarget earnings for this role is in terms of market rate and then that's it. Okay? Keeps it simple. And her job and I would say this.
(6:39:28) I'll just give you a little speech that I I've given more times than I care to share. I call it the cell phone speech. All right? So the way it works is this. You say, "Hey, what's her name?" The girl uh Paige. Okay? So it's like, "Hey, Paige." We're going to put Paige's picture on the wall and it says this location I'm you know I'm a this is Paige's location. That way she has some some actual ownership over when she walks in.
(6:39:44) She feels some some pride of ownership of the of the four walls. Okay. Beyond that you say, "Okay, Paige. So, I'm going to give you your base plus this profit share." But let me tell you what I'm giving this profit share for. When something happens, this phone which I hold in my hand doesn't ring. So, let's role play it. Someone falls and breaks their back.
(6:40:06) What do you do? If any answer is call me, it's the wrong answer. That's what I'm pay. That's what I'm trading for. And so that I just walk and you role play a couple and it's ridiculous and it's absurd. But then it's like, okay, they get it. It's like I'm giving you this so you don't bother me.
(6:40:25) And then under these two conditions is when you can you can you can call me if there's something that's over $10,000 or over a thou, you know, whatever the number is uh that's relevant for you uh that's a financial decision, you call me. Otherwise, this place is yours and I fronted all the capital and I'm going to make sure it's full and you work it and you get your base that's guaranteed plus you get 20% or whatever the number is of the profit.
(6:40:47) And do you think I should avoid profit sharing at different numbers versus product or services? Because I was thinking, no, just do profit on the whole location. Just do profit on the whole location. Yeah. Yeah. Because she's going to be she's going to be pushing all of it, right? If you think about it, you want to have your the incentives of an operator to be as close to the incentives of you.
(6:41:07) So the the broader and more general the profit share plan, the more they're aligned with your incentives versus just pushing specific things. It's like you want it to be more holistically aligned with the entire P&L rather than any one thing because otherwise people start gaming it.
(6:41:25) So the really really uh like if you had a business that people sold tickets then it's simple to have like okay at 100 tickets you get this at 200 tickets you get why because they literally only do one thing every day. If you have a more generalized set of directions that's okay we got to answer the phone I got to clean the desk I got to I got to sell stuff I got to deliver then just having a more overarching incentive structure makes more sense. Yeah.
(6:41:44) Cool. No that makes sense. Yeah. Appreciate it. Rock and roll. Appreciate you man. Cool. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Donate some books. All right. Bye. I will. All right. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Take one last one. Okay. Samantha, who's it? You want You want Samantha? Yeah. All right. Here we go.
(6:42:04) Samantha winner. You're last up. Samantha better answer. Samantha better answer. Hello. Hi Samantha. It's Laya and Alex for Mosie. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? Are you still watching the live or are you just uh verbal? Yes, I am still watching the live. Amazing. How can we be of service? Yeah.
(6:42:31) So, I guess uh well, first off, like we run a tutoring company. So, we're prep for success tutors and we run basically for ELSAT tutoring. Our biggest problem is retention. So in terms of retention of tutors as well as retention of clients because we do a pay as you go model and we totally understand that that is probably not the best thing but it does help with the sale initially. Yeah.
(6:42:57) Um and then in terms of tutoring uh or sorry our tutors having like a gig before law school is a lot of what our tutors do but getting like full-time tutors is definitely challenging. So that's our two biggest problems. So I I almost started a tutoring business. Um and so I really because I I like standardized testing, which is weird, but anyways.
(6:43:22) Um I let's let's separate the problems here. All right. So you've got the the tutor issue in terms of retention and then you've got the the client issue, right? Yes. Now, what you didn't say, but I saw in the in the in the text that I got, you're getting you're doing 7 million topline, four million bottom line, right? Yes. Uh girl, you're smoking it.
(6:43:40) We're we're we're the broke version of you and Ila. Me and my wife. No, you guys are the rich version. You guys are awesome. You guys are killing it. Yeah. My my husband's here with me. We basically are started the company together in college. I I do like the HR marketing side and he mainly does the sales side.
(6:43:57) So, he helps me out with that side and I kind of do a lot of the brings behind the scenes. Oh, so you haven't split it the way we do it. So, I have it. So, Leila does everything and I take the credit. That's the uh that's the split. It's so good. You'll get there, man. You'll get there. You just got to keep slowly giving things to her and not responding to people. I'm not tired at all.
(6:44:13) Yeah. Yeah. So, I could keep going salary that she got to spend so she feels like we're broke and invest the rest. Well, great. Okay. So, I I just want to say you're doing you're doing seven top, four million bottom. Like I don't think there might be anything necessarily wrong with the business. I think I Yeah.
(6:44:31) One thing this might be a feature, not a bug. Yes. So, it's kind of a pick your problem, which is like the current problem you have is the the one with the tutoring and the clients, but it's like, okay, in order to fix that problem, you change the business model, which allows you to make this money.
(6:44:48) And there is literally no business in existence that doesn't have a downside. Every business has the problem that you have to continuously tackle for years and years because it is the downside. We call it like I like to say the downside of the upside. Like what makes your business so good is also what creates this problem for This is the hard. Yep. Mhm. You have a really healthy business. There's We looked at a lot of tutoring.
(6:45:08) Oh, yeah. You guys are great. You guys are doing great. Awesome. Awesome. Is there anything that you would say that could tweak it to maybe even make it better though? So, you So, I'll say this. I'll say this. You guys have you have really good margins right now, right? So you could absolutely pay people pay a couple people to take a lot of stuff off your plate and probably not impact your margin that much.
(6:45:32) So if you said I'm going to allocate $500,000 to bring some real talent in two two people at 250 who are a monsters, like you guys your your your standard of living would go up so dramatically and I'll bet you you'd still fill your time up to go grow the business and then you'd end up still making more absolute. I'm happy to pay that.
(6:45:52) Can you help me find those two people? Just got to do the dude. Like it's just you just got to you got to kiss a lot of frogs. Yeah, you got a lot of frogs. A lot of toads. Is it toads or frogs? Am I a toad? Is there any um way that you would suggest to hiring those is like Indeed, Zip Recruiter, LinkedIn recruiting? Like is there talent? Um do you guys have social media presence? Uh we're we're starting with it.
(6:46:16) We haven't. Um, but within the last like probably six months or so, we've been producing probably about two to three videos a day and just trying to get stuff out. That's great. Honestly, reputation and just, you know, paid ads and, you know, we got over 300 fivestar Google reviews. It's really good. Okay.
(6:46:36) So, first off, I think um posting it on your social medias like you would be shocked. That's the first thing. The second thing is I always think when I have like a very specific role I'm looking for that's hard especially in any business. I re like it sounds and it's not scalable but you do the unscalable which is like your network like who do I know that knows this person? Where does this person exist? And I think we still do that to this day which is like who do I know that knows a person with this skill 100%. I call them text them. I think the problem is is like our network is all broke people like we from
(6:47:06) nothing. No, I hear you. I hear you. That's fair. No. So you like you go in the places they're at. That's like joining the communities, join the forums, join the Slack threads, join the Discord groups, join the school communities. Go ahead. The the next piece that I I would suggest for you guys is doing basically make a list of 10 places, 20 places where these people already work and then you reach out to them yourself.
(6:47:30) Gotcha. Because like and that's what a lot of people won't do, but I will tell you it has there are people in this building right now that are because I did that. Oh, what are these two people? What are their roles? What would you say? What are the names of the roles? Director of marketing, director of like what what do you think those two roles are for this company? You mind if I take this one? Yeah. I'm going to give you a Lea answer.
(6:47:52) So, the first thing we would do is you do a time study on your calendars because right now the business is small. So, you guys are probably each wearing like three hats each. Yeah. So, when you do that Yeah, I'm sure. And so, what we basically have to do is like you guys are both junk drawers right now. you're doing a little bit of everything.
(6:48:10) You've done some delineation, but I'll bet you there's a ton of crossover and there's a ton of other stuff, right? And so, we have to look at all the things you're currently spending your time on and then think, okay, does any of these bucket together into a role that actually makes sense that we could attract someone who might have a relevant skill set? That's how I think Leila would answer it. No, I mean, it's it's the truth. It's And listen, you're going to have to guess. And in the beginning, it's kind
(6:48:34) of like just it'll change. You have to be okay with the fact that there's going to be uncertainty. Like even we can't give you the certainty because I post jobs all the time and then I'm like, "Oh, I get feedback from the market when I'm talking to people and I'm like, "Oh, it's actually probably not a director, it's a manager." Or, you know what, I actually think that that's a specialist and it's not a lead.
(6:48:51) Like, you're going to have to adjust as you go. Um, and even now like I take like I would take that time study, put it into AI and be like, "Tell me what job descriptions fit these responsibilities out of all the ones on LinkedIn, Zipper Group, like all the places." Now, now write me Now write me a job description. Now write me a great opening.
(6:49:11) Tell me what title you think is appropriate. Exactly. And I'd love to get to about 20 million, you know, top line, you know, 11 12 bottom line. Um, it's about, you know, a two and a half X, let's call it. Um I think if I just take right now our average client does about 20 hours of tutoring it does you know our prep program is normally around 50 to do to feel fully prepared for the ELSAT.
(6:49:35) Um I know we can take it from 2 to 50 but I just I mean from 20 to 50 hours um but I guess how do I better focus on that client retention and having them stick around to do a full 50 hour program. I'll actually I'm going to bet you right now that this is a this is actually a money model thing is how can we reposition the offer such that we can get a way higher percentage of people to choose on their own to just buy the 50 and then are there financing partners that we can set up as well uh to make this a little bit easier for some people? Those would be that like that's like my first my first inclination. I want to give people the pay as you go
(6:50:06) option. they just kind of do 20 hours and not not as many build up to the 50 which and so then the question is like how can I incentivize someone to not want to do that and so you have pay as you go pay as you go can be one of two options so it's like listen everybody feels repaired at 50 or like 80 you know collect the stats 89% of people feel prepared at 50 hours okay so this is what we want most people to do we also understand that it's not necessarily you know some people are poor because you guys are students or whatever it is and so it's like we have this financing
(6:50:34) partner also because it's education and because it's an established field for like legal. There probably are pretty decent lending partners for things that are related to that. That would be my bet. And so I would say we do this and then in the instance that that does not work then we have the pay as you go model as a downell. Uhhuh.
(6:50:53) Yeah. And I think that and I guess Yeah. Go ahead. Go. I was going to say what my other question was why didn't you start the test prep business? I know you were close to it. You did well on the GMAT. You're good at test taking like myself. You know, I I got a perfect score on the SAT math. My parents have been doing like math competitions. I was a young kid. Yeah.
(6:51:10) So, I kind of can connect on that. But I guess why didn't you jump into that space? Uh because I was emotional. So, I did this whole curriculum. I put all this stuff together and I was supposed to partner with one of my college professors and I gave him all the stuff and then he ended up just like going and doing it because I didn't understand how like business worked.
(6:51:33) And you know what? It might have been not a big deal or whatever, but to me at the time I felt so um what do you call it? Betrayed. Yeah, betrayed's a little strong, but yeah, I snuffed um that I just I I was like, "Nope, I'll do something else." And so then I just decided not to do it. Is that a logical decision-making process? Absolutely not. I just I just chose not to do that decently well for you. Yeah, it worked out okay.
(6:51:51) It worked out okay. So, I mean, you're doing fine now. Thank you. I appreciate it. What I don't like about the business is if we do a good job, people don't need us anymore. That's okay. Every business. Let me Yeah. Let me give you the other side of it. Every year there's more. Yeah. Yeah. Right. They make new ones every year. Yeah. Okay. So, I appreciate you guys.
(6:52:14) Rock and roll. Donate some books. Feed some entrepreneurs. Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Seriously, thank you. And thank you on behalf of the 200 entrepreneurs that you give books to. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye. Tutuloo. All right. So, do you want to do this one? What? We're going to close this down. We're going to close it down. Are we closing it down? For real. We are. We're closing down. You're done. You're like, I'm done.
(6:52:37) What? You're done. Me? Yeah. Are you? Uh, if you got to pee now. All right. Okay, fine. Then I will I will do this one last one last run. Okay. 10 minutes. I can stand up here. What? I can stand here for 10 minutes. I can hold it. You can hold it free with 200 books. You look great, by the way. All right.
(6:53:02) So, for those of you who are who just hopped on who just recently hopped on in the last in the last seven hours, let me tell you. So, we started today and for those of you who are newer, which probably is like at least half of you or more. Um, I did something that was pretty crazy. All right, so I wrote this book.
(6:53:25) Um, it's been four years that I had uh $100 million offers, $100 million leads, and $100 million money models. And so, I wrote all those books at once, and then I've released them two years apart. And the plan was to show each of literally demonstrate the concepts of each of the books when I release the book.
(6:53:45) So offers was just supposed to be an unbelievable offer. So good you feel stupid saying no that it would grow on it on its own with word of mouth and that's exactly what it did. And so today four years later it's still number one in every category that it's in. It's got 26,000 fivestar reviews and it was because it was a grand slam offer. It had a course that came with it for free. No opt-in.
(6:54:01) The book started at I think at 99 cents or 199 whatever it was on Amazon. Um and many people consumed it. Leads was a book all about advertising. So then I took the same concept the offer then wrapped in the second layer of okay if you have an amazing offer then you also advertise the hell out of it and we had the first mega launch which was two years ago.
(6:54:20) Then this one two years later this is about monetization and so it's about the 15 mechanisms that allow you to monetize uh a a customer relationship and ideally the ways that are most mutually beneficial to the business and to the customer and said simply it allows you to get customers spend more money in less time over and over again. It accelerates the cash conversion cycle. And so we advertised this event.
(6:54:39) So we took the offer concept, wrapped in the advertising concept, and then also wrapped on top of the money model concept so that we could run an event like this and have it effectively be free. So we spent $4 million in advertising and then as of this morning, I think we had something like $7 million in book sales before we started today.
(6:54:59) So we basically broke even on running an event of this size. And the only way we're able to do that is because of the money model mechanism inside the book. All right? And so for everybody who was here at the very beginning of the day, number one, um there's a whole system that I recorded, I think it's eight or nine hours that breaks down the book in a course format um that you will get for free just for being here. Okay? So it's eight hour course. It's amazing.
(6:55:24) It shows how you do attraction offers, upsell offers, downell offers, continuity offers. Everyone gets that for free. Number one. Number two, I recorded the audio book for this. Instead of it being for sale, it's also free. So you get the course for free, you get the audiobook for free right off the bat. Number three, over this period of time, I also chugged a beer.
(6:55:50) But besides that, besides that, I also wrote a secret fourth book called The Lost Chapters. This book is the same level of quality and depth as the other three books. is just stuff that was either too advanced or too niche or too siloed for a specific industry for me to be able to put it in the the main cannon of the books. But this thing slays. All right. And this is also free. It's a digital copy for everyone who's here live.
(6:56:13) Just to be clear, anybody who's not here live is not going to get this. This will be for sale for $29.99 after this event, as soon as this live stream is over. All right? So, you guys came here live and so you will get a copy of this for free. So, you get the Money Models course for free. You get the Money Models audio book for free.
(6:56:31) you get this digital version for free which will be for sale after the event. So that's the third thing you get. The fourth thing you get is that some of you guys know that I'm an investor in school, right? Well really coowner. Um and when I when I invested the money two years ago in stool school, one of the big stipulations was three things.
(6:56:52) Number one, I I wanted to have a way for it to be cheaper for people who wanted to get started because one of the biggest things that people have who follow my stuff, I have like as of for this event, 65% of people who came here were business owners, but 25 35% of people were not business owners.
(6:57:09) And so it's like what do you do for for all of all of y'all, right? And I want to make sure that took care of you guys because you guys have always been awesome. And so the first thing we did was we put all of the money models mechanisms inside of school. So you can actually do it in the platform. So school now can facilitate the 15 mechanisms that exist inside of the money models training and book. You can actually execute them.
(6:57:28) So rather than just reading about them, you can turn them into reality. Okay, that's number one. Number two, school has been 14 days free since its inception. It's never changed 14 days free. four and a half, five, whatever it is now, except for right now, just for the launch until next Saturday.
(6:57:52) And instead of 14 days free, you're not going to get 14 days free. You probably won't even get 30 days free. Well, I mean, you could if you wanted to, but I'm going to give you more than that. You won't get 45 days free or even 60 days free. But I wanted to give you 90 days free.
(6:58:10) three months to be able to actually get going, start your business, use money models using the platform. It's free. And the third stipulation uh for for for the deal two years ago was that when the time was right, which now feels like the time, we were able to drive down the price from $99 a month, which is what school has been for four plus years, to $9 a month.
(6:58:32) So that after the 90 days and you will be able to keep that price for life if you sign up the next week. Okay? And so inside of the school, it has all that stuff in there. You also don't have to do that. I have it on my website as well. All right? So it's not like a mandatory thing, but it's my gift to you so you guys can actually get going. And I do this because I get it.
(6:58:52) I've been broke and I wanted to make something so that if you were like if you have nothing, you can make something of yourself. So there's no more excuse. You have every single tool. You can process payments. You can host everything. You literally need no more technology. And all the information you need to get started is there. It's all yours for free. That's my gift to you. Everybody who's a beginner.
(6:59:11) Now, my mission, the reason that we did this whole launch, this was a five, six year plan for me for the trilogy of the $100 million series was that I thought it would be really elegant if the hundred million dollar series could finish with a meta concept of every single book, demonstrating the concept of the book.
(6:59:27) And it would be also really elegant if we could do a hund00 million in sales in a day with a hundred million dollar series. That's why I called it that. And so, this has been not a a 12-week thing, not even a 12-month thing. This has been many years in the making. And a lot of pieces went together to put this together.
(6:59:46) And so the mission was for this was I wanted to be able to put these books in the hands of every entrepreneur in America. That's 32 and a half million business owners. So we're not even close. We're about a tenth of the way there. But at least hopefully you will believe me when I'm taking it seriously that we really want to do that.
(7:00:04) And so in in service of that mission, the idea was, okay, what can I do to incentivize business owners, the other 65% of the room who are business owners to help me make that happen? And so that's what came the idea of donating 200 bucks to help other entrepreneurs get these things into their hands. And so I'm not going to expect you to just donate 200 bucks.
(7:00:25) So I wanted to make it worth your while. and I wanted to make it the best business decision of the year easily. And so when you donate 200 bucks, this is what I'll give you on top for free just for helping us support this cause and helping other entrepreneurs. So the first thing that you're going to get when you donate 200 bucks is the lead system.
(7:00:44) So we found out there was four systems that businesses needed to get unstuck. So, either they have a lack of quality leads, they can't convert the prospects they got, they can't deliver, or they have a pricing issue around profit. And if you saw some of the calls that I just took, I probably should have bucketed them better for you, but it fell usually in one of these four categories.
(7:01:07) And so, I spent the last two years with the team. We had 1,26 plus business owners who came to our inerson our headquarters so that we could figure out and actually codify all the problems. And by codifying them, we're able to create checklists and literal scripts to follow for them to actually solve their specific constraint.
(7:01:26) But if you imagine, if you have a leads issue, I can't just solve it with one thing. There's usually going to be two, three, maybe four things that have to get solved depending on what type of uh way you get customers, if you're more ads driven, if you're more content organic driven, if you're if you just need to more uh more operational flows, you just need to increase volume.
(7:01:44) These are all the checklists that we use, the playlist, the things that we literally gave people that paid $35,000. they would get a portion of one of these. I'm giving you all 12 for free when you donate 200 bucks. All right? So, you'll get the lead system which includes goed ads which shows you how to scale. We got up to 500,000 a day in ads using this system. This per day, all right, using goed ads playbook.
(7:02:04) We also get the hooks playbook, which if you think about the hooks is really the tip of the spear for every kind of marketing you have. If you do nothing but make your hooks twice as effective, you can double the business. Again, that's an illustration. I'm not promising that for you.
(7:02:15) saying that's what happens if you double the front end of a business branding many of you have already realized that on a long enough time horizon you need to develop a brand you need to build a brand and so there's a way to do that and I was somebody who's very slow to learn extremely slow to learn this and so I had to figure out how to actually do it because brand is big amorphous thing was like how do you actually build a brand right this shows you how to do it and then the marketing machine will help you pull your face away and actually put operational flows in place so that you don't have to be
(7:02:39) the one who's marketing okay you can actually have your customers and other flows be the things that drive the marketing for you. So that's the lead system. You get all four of those playbooks free. That's number one. When you donate 200 bucks, the second system, the sales system. All right. So lead nurture playbook.
(7:02:58) This helps you get two things. More schedules, more shows. If you do nothing else in the business, the business grows. If you get more schedu and more of the schedule show, it's a double bump on sales. All right. This comes from all the findings I had from Allen.
(7:03:19) Basically everything that I learned from owning one company that all it did was lead nurture I put into this book and this how we have routinely 89% so far this year show rates for this whole year at acquisition.com 89% show rates and it's not because it's one thing it's like 28 tiny things and we learned it because I hired this data scientist from Russia to look at hundreds of thousands of appointments and figure out what is every single thing that increases throughput and we put them all in here.
(7:03:38) That's the first thing that you'll get for free in the sales system. The second is the closing handbook. So, when I was broke and $100,000 in debt, I had to fly out to train my salespeople so that I wasn't going to lose everything.
(7:03:55) All right? And so, inside of here, I have the best closes that I know that I drilled people on that actually closed deals. And I would say the highlight of this is something that I figured out, which is the seven universal closes. Now, this is something that I've never talked about publicly in all the sales content, and I've yet to hear anybody else who talks about sales talk about them.
(7:04:12) But what are the closes that if you if you knew nothing else, you have to know these seven and you can teach it to any new sales rep. Because fundamentally, what it allows you to do is ask again and again and again without being pushy or offensive. And I'll show you how to reframe framework so you can continue to get shots on goal because fundamentally the people who ask the most get the most, but they're also the people who fend the most.
(7:04:31) So, how do you balance that? How do you balance those two things? That playbook shows you how. That's also free. On top of that, you have the proof checklist. Right now, if you're not closing sales fast enough, it's because you don't have enough the right kind of proof displayed at the right time, the right kind of way.
(7:04:47) And so, with the proof checklist, you can implement this throughout your entire sales process to accelerate cash conversion. And so, that's the sales system. You get the nurture playbook, the closing playbook, and the proof checklist free. So, you get all four lead system free, all three of the sales system free when you donate 200 bucks, which you can do at go.acq.com. at acq.com. The next one is the delivery system.
(7:05:04) So it's like, okay, you got your leads, you're selling, but what about delivery? And so one of the big issues sometimes, you heard some of the calls is lifetime value. People aren't worth enough to me. And so sometimes people think it's a leads issue, but really you're just not making enough per customer. You make too little. And so there's eight different ways you can transact with the customer.
(7:05:23) And this is a value mapping exercise that we run internally in order to generate more sales. And inside of here, if you have not if you do nothing else, I think I told one of the people in there, um, this is the thing that can generate more LTV. So that's the first. The second is churn is retention. So school obviously we have millions of memberships.
(7:05:42) And so we have access to so much data on what actually drives retention for any kind of subscriptions. And so we took all the learnings and put it into here. And this is the reason that school can went from a million to 15 plus million users in 18 months, right? Is the learnings that I put inside of here. We spent $6.5 million, right, on just learning this this little thing.
(7:06:00) How do we do this, right? On how do we convert from point A to point B inside of here. It's yours for free when you donate books to other entrepreneurs. Okay. And then the fourth system is the profit system. This is the fastest, lowest operational drag that you can change in your business today. All right. And so this is the fast cash playbook.
(7:06:18) Every business needs to have ways to generate cash quickly, whether it's taxes, emergencies, funding, expansion, or, you know, like I said, personal favorite, just giving yourself a raise. All right? And so, I learned this the hard way, but you should be able to run these two to four times a year that you can run to your existing list.
(7:06:34) And if you're B2B, you can show these plays and run them for your clients. And if you are B toC, you just run these yourself and it'll give you a calendar system so that you can actually promote on a calendar. and all of the extra revenue that comes from existing customers drops disproportionately to the bottom line. Not a promise that's going to happen. I'm just saying that's how it works.
(7:06:54) Now, the second of the profit system is pricing. I could write multiple books on pricing. These are my top 10 instant pricing optimizations. I told a story earlier about a guy named Tusaintain. He might be on here still. Um he did he he does has a marketing agency for stem cell clinics just by following this which he just he read on his plane flight home. All right.
(7:07:11) These are all engineered to be one sitting. the goal is not to overwhelm you. The goal is to give you the fewest things that you can use to grow your business the most. And so he he read it on the plane flight home and then all he did was he just reposition the offer using the pricing variables inside of here and he was able to triple the amount of customers you bought and triple his LTV. I'm not saying it's going to happen for you.
(7:07:34) His results are different, but I'm saying that is the power of pricing. It's the strongest lever on profitability for a business. And so you get all 10 instant pricing pricing optimizations in here plus 17 rules for pricing my pricing algorithms that are all here for free. And the third and last one is that if you are going to change your prices, you're going to want to do it with a system. All right.
(7:07:53) I had I've led a lot like a lot a lot like many hundreds I guess probably thousand now of businesses through price raises or price changes. Learning how to communicate that in a way that minimizes the risk to the business so you can sell as many customers on your new way of doing business as possible is one of the most profitable things you can do.
(7:08:11) And so inside of here, it has the most battle tested letter that shows you every single part, how to fill in the blanks, how to send it, how to pick your pricing sweet spot, how to have a trap door for for customers so you don't lose them even if you change the price. All of the little tricks and tips that took me a very long time to learn and you can just do it right on the first shot. So that's the price raise letter.
(7:08:27) So you're going to get all 12 of these playbooks, which people pay $35,000 for just one of them. And that's not marketer math. That's what people actually pay. That's what they came. They got one day and they got a portion one of these. you if you help me donate 200 bucks, which is why I'm trying to do this, which is why this is absurd.
(7:08:43) That's why these numbers are so insane because the people who have come here and paid $35,000 are like, "This is insane." And that's why I'm doing this. It is insane. I'm also trying to put a book in the hands of every entrepreneur in America. That's insane. So, I have to do insane stuff, too. So, you'll get the lead system, including goed ads, hooks, branding, and marketing uh marketing machine free.
(7:09:01) You're going to get the sales system, which include lead literature, closing, and proof checklist free. You're going to get the lifetime value and the retention playbook free. And you're going to get fast cash, pricing, and price race playbook in the pricing, the profit system free. All four system, all 12 playbooks absolutely free when you donate 200 bucks to entrepreneurs. You can go to go.acq.
(7:09:18) com right now to do it. All right? Because the moment this thing ends, one of these bonuses is disappearing. And I'm going to show you which one it is. Now, over that same period of time, I did 226 one-on-one consultations with business owners. They paid $135,000. $135,000 for that consultation.
(7:09:40) And I did it over two years, which is insane, which is all of these are my actual notes from every one of those consultations. And I did it for one reason, despite the fact that it was an entirely unscalable model. I wanted to build something that could scale. And that's why we built ACQAI.
(7:09:55) And so we trained it on all three of the books, all the notes that are not published from the books, all 12 of the implementation playbooks, and all 226 of my one-on-one consultations. So that every single type of business could be like, "Well, what do you do for this? What do you do for that?" I did it probably once or more than once of a business like that.
(7:10:13) And so, you can ask the questions to help it personalize which playbook for you and how to make it specific for your industry. This $31 million of consulting work went into this. It's yours for free. You donate 200 bucks. And if you're like, "Well, which playbook is going to be right for me right now? How do I use the tool?" That's why you have a full day virtual implementation workshop. So Leila's going to be there. I'm going to be there.
(7:10:38) We're going to show you how to wield these tools with skill so you can actually apply them to your business, right? We train our people on how to use our own AI so that we can provide better advisory work. We're going to show you how to use our internal tools. Probably one of the most valuable things I can do. And so you can bring whoever you want to that because it is virtual. So that's one of the advantages. So if you have a team who you want to bring with you, you can bring them. All right.
(7:10:56) These tickets are also free and included when you donate 200 bucks to other entrepreneurs. And the last one is this. So we just broke the non-fiction fast or the fastest gez I don't remember the fastest selling non-fiction book in history.
(7:11:23) We just surpassed George Bush, Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, and Prince Harry for the last five spots to have the fastests selling non-fiction book in history. And the reason that I was so passionate about that was because when I looked at the list, the other ones below that, the top 10, all politicians. And listen, I, you know, I got no beef with politicians.
(7:11:39) I'd prefer to stay alive. All right? But the thing is this, it felt weird to me that people who have all this media that was state sponsored, all of them were the leaders for the non-fiction book sales. I was like, this is And most of them have ghostriters. They even write their own books.
(7:11:57) And I was like, one of us should do it, right? An entrepreneur should do We're the ones paying all the taxes. We're the ones footing all the bills. We're the ones taking all the risks. We're the ones getting sued every day. We should be the ones doing this. And so, we broke the record earlier today.
(7:12:15) And uh the record's still going until uh 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, I think. And so, inside of here is the launch blackbook. So, it contains every single email, every single text, the affiliate recruitment blackbook, the entire campaign spaced out, the blueprint day by day of what we did to plan for this, the internal memos explaining the different offers that we had created, a 200 book and an 800 book bundle. The 800 book bundles for the super ballers.
(7:12:41) If you're a big business owner, it's on the thank you page after you donate 200. And inside of here, like I spent $4 million on ads, and that's just on the ads. what I spent on creating this cost me even more. And you're going to get this the entire thing for free when you donate 200 bucks. All right? So, you're going to get the lead system free. You're going to get the sales system free. You get the delivery system free. You're going to get the profit system free.
(7:13:03) You're going to get the ACQA free. 30 million $31 million of consulting work. ACQ virtual impation workshop and the launch blackbook free when you donate 200 books at go.acq.com. And this launch blackbook will disappear the moment this live stream ends. And this is the launch blackbook that just broke the world record. So, I feel like it's pretty cool. All right. So, this ends.
(7:13:28) Do we do a timer? Is that how we're going to do this? So, if you're on the fence, now's the time to do it. Now's the time to do it. Let's do a countdown. All right. You want to do a countdown? Can we do that? Give us a 60 seconds. 60. Give them five minutes. 60 seconds. I saw some people in the chat just diving heart attacks. All right, five minutes.
(7:13:47) You got till 6:30. Three minutes. Give them three minutes. All right, if you want to go, go.q.com. That disappears. Do we have a timer somewhere? Someone said three minute timer. All right, I'll set it on a phone. I got a phone. You got a phone? Don't worry, I got a real phone. All right. Can we show show the official? Oh, we got time. We got time clock there. There we go.
(7:14:10) We got You want to show it? We got to show it. All right. All right. The official timer has started. There's three minutes and then this thing ends. All right. So, go to go.acq.com. Everything that's here behind us, all of this you get for free when you donate 200 bucks to other entrepreneurs. You'll get an email code that uh that you can redeem.
(7:14:31) So, if you're like, well, I don't want to distribute them. Don't worry. It was the number one request from last year. Uh we will distribute the books for you. Um and if you're like, hey, I want 10 books. It's like that's fine. Just redeem the code for 10 and then pay for shipping and handling and then the other 190 or whatever you don't use. We'll distribute on your behalf.
(7:14:49) The code is good for a year. All right? So, give as many as you want away. They're good for a year. On top of that, just to be clear, it's a 100% dollar for-doll tax deduction for businesses. All right? So, if you donate books, it's a tax deduction. On top of that, like worst case scenario, you get the tax deduction.
(7:15:07) You can sell the darn books if you want to. At the end of the day, as long as you put it in entrepreneurs hands, I'm good with it. All right. So, these books, uh, you can sell them and then just keep all the bonuses, right? 10 minutes. All right. On top of that, um, you can give these away as a lead magnet if you wanted to to get new customers, to join a community, to show up for sales calls, to, uh, leave reviews for the business.
(7:15:25) You can give it as a gift. All of these things um you can do. And also, you can just feel good about helping two other 200 entrepreneurs out. All right. So lead system, sales system, delivery system, uh profit system, HQAI, HQ for implementation workshop and tickets for as many people as you want on your team.

Transcript:
(00:00) I will get there for now I grind it will pay off in what I build or who I become I hit my goal or I grow either way I win welcome to the one of zero Show episode 2 advice for achieving your goals faster than everyone else I'll be taking questions from the audience live who what's up everyone happy uh Happy Wednesday in whatever time zone you're in thank you for joining us on the one of zero show so this is something that backed by popular demand uh we tried it uh a few weeks ago you guys liked it so uh we are doing it again we repeating successful actions so as long as you
(00:39) guys keep liking it we will keep doing it today's theme is around uh goal setting um but I'll be super transparent with you I uh I was talking to a family member who's probably going to die in the next you know certain period of time um and it so you're definitely going to get me in a little bit of a a mood um around that so I said that as a little bit of a preface uh for our for our conversations today um so when I when I give you responses take them the way I mean them uh which is hopefully the good way all right so let's uh let's rock and
(01:13) roll Alex what's up man Joe what's up man how's it going dude doing fantastic hey sorry to hear about your family member by the way brother that's very unfortunate we we all die that's right that's right and I really appreciate everything you do for the community between your books and your free content man you're the man you've helped me change my life dramatically dude you're like a god so you know I want to get that out of the way I got the acquisition hat is the lead book just show you big gu big big fan of your work
(01:43) man well thanks what can I help you with man so uh I had a question about setting really large goals because obviously you've sat and had a ton of large goals and throughout your entrepreneur journey and you know whether that be uh annual revenue for a business weight loss personal savings Etc things with uh a definite ending to it how would you would you say it's better to set a time frame for these large goals and have a shoot for the star land of the moons mentality and not hit it or have a time frame that you know you're going to hit
(02:20) it in and is it easier when you have these large goals to chunk them into the smaller goals along the way so that way you feel like you're progressing throughout throughout the Journey of the larger goal yeah um it's a good question and I'm glad we're starting off with this one um I see both of the examples that you gave as kind of extremes that don't necessarily need to exist um because both of theirs are based on outcome based expectations whether it's short or long um and The more I've been doing
(02:50) this the more I make my goals around things that are 100% controllable and so the outcome on the short term or the outcome on the long term neither of those are controllable but the activity that I can commit to are controllable and those activities I can measure progress against them even on percentage of days that I do the activities I said I would do and so it's like somebody who says they want to lose weight and it's much better to say like well why don't you just go to the gym um and so like actually there's a an employee who's
(03:19) just starting to go to the gym um and he was like what program should I follow and I was like your program is binary is that did you go to the gym I was like that's youram yeah and the first month I want to just see how how many days you do it and then next month we'll try and increase that number and then once you can do it all the days that you're supposed to be going then we can start adding things but until then I don't think there's any point in anyone putting any effort into what your programming is because you can't stick with [ __ ] right and so um to your the
(03:46) second half of what you said which is like do you break things down into like very very minute level I pretty much only do that because I I basically say okay this is what would be cool but if it doesn't happen or it does is relatively irrelevant because I think that if I do these things that'll happen but the only thing I can control is doing these things and then what happens is if I if I if I hit a 100% of my doing these things and then the goal doesn't happen I will still feel like I accomplished what I said I was going to do and so um that built my own
(04:20) confidence in terms of my sticking with my word because that's the that's like one of the few things I care a lot about is that if I say I'm going to do it I'll do it and so then what you can then do is Alter your hypothesis around goal setting so this is going to be for everybody so this isn't Just For You Joe um I probably should have done this at the at the at the Forefront of how we set goals but at acis.
(04:46) com we have a very simple process for setting goals number one is we say what problem are we solving and that problem should chunk up to one of three things either we're going to this if we solve this problem it's preventing us from getting more customers so if we solve it we'll get more customers it's going to we're not making enough money per customer so if we solve it we'll make more money per customer and number three is that it's going to decrease our risk of either of the first two happening over the long term which increases Enterprise Value right so if you think about the value of a company overall it's number of customers times
(05:13) LTV or lifetime value and how long that will happen and How likely that will continue to happen in the long run and so all bucket so that help if they're like hey I think we should make this a goal I'd be like well how's it going to do one of these three things and if they can't explain it then it's probably not worth doing which many things could improve a business but we have limited resources and the job of the CEO is to allocate money and effort and so if we're the allocator of those resources we have to make sure it's going to the bucket's going to get us the highest return so number one column
(05:45) is does it get us more customers does it make them worth more uh or is it decreasing the risk that uh those things are going to stop happening in the future that's column one column two is what's my hypothesis so I believe that if we do this F if we do X Y will happen right that's so it's just a hypothesis statement because we we make these goals but there's always an underlying assumption that we think something's going to happen if we do this I think if I double the amount of videos I put out I'm going to get more clicks to my website that's the hypothesis now the
(06:16) goal that we're trying to solve is get more customers my hypothesis if I double my number of videos that I make I'll get more customers or get more clicks to my site cool so then column three and column four is what is X and what is y right which is what is the thing I'm going to do and what do I going to happen and so that's the first part of the goal setting that's all we do what problem are we solving What's the hypothesis what's the X which is the input what's the Y which is the output that's all we do we do with every single
(06:40) company that's what we do every quarter that's we do every every annual planning that's what we do after the quarter or the time period's over we then have two more columns to say did we do X did we actually double our number of videos and then did why happen because you can also set you can double your number of videos but then you find out that your quality drops and so you actually didn't get the number of clicks that you thought to your site so you had a hypothesis but it was wrong and we're like okay so we need to amend our hypothesis we have to
(07:08) double our number of videos while also making sure that we script them and have ideas that are just as good as they were before so then we have to solve that problem right but that is the process that we that we tackle all of our goals and I have I have spent less and less time thinking huge huge amounts in the future I mean exciting stuff sure if you're Vision casting for the team to say like this is the big problem we're going after but in terms of the doing this of the business everything's down
(07:34) to like what are the activities what are we committing to and then the outcomes take care of themselves and as far as I'm concerned if the entire team did everything they said they were going to do and we didn't achieve any of those quote outcomes that doesn't matter to me at all wow yeah there was a lot unack there uh very very insightful stuff I love when you go on like the Riff uh I'll definitely have to play that one back and take notes man that was really just break down the activities just break down like you have so what's the goal that you have right now what whatting so that kind of goes into my
(08:09) second question so there's a big goal okay um early on in your career you know because I follow I know your story uh you know you had one of your mentors switch you from doing the local gyms into consultancy license model with gym launch so you know my main goal for this year and going forward is and it's just I'm kind of in Crossroads and what exactly I should do because I really want to help as many people as possible that is my like big term goal and I think my biggest uh you know leverage activity that I could do to help as many people as possible is to do a similar model to yours to help struggling
(08:46) landscape owners get from zero to1 million do in gross revenue with you know 20 30% margins um but what advice would you give to me if you were in my shoes while still trying to grow my landscape business and switch to this business model and start a you know consult uh model yeah so right now what you have is a strategic question um rather than really a goal like you have a directional question that you need to make a decision about within the business and so most brick and mortar business owners kind of have three three potential paths that they can expand
(09:19) right so one is just private ownership you just continue to own and open more and more locations all right that's number one number two um is kind of in between there is you kind of have a franchise uh franchise model right you have you test you know you have one to five locations of your own that you own at corporate and then you franchise the model out you can license model out whatever um the the furthest from that is what I would consider just more of an education based business which is which is sounds like what you were kind of referencing
(09:49) um at at scale all three of those help lots of people so I wouldn't say that one way helps more than another and even the advice that I got at that time I don't know if I would have given me that advice that's just the advice that I got because if I had gone back in time I might have 200 gems right now and IID probably be just as rich as I am now so you know what I mean like it winners will win and problem I'll say this is that the problem with starting over because that's what this is is that when you start into this new thing you're starting at zero because you're now
(10:23) competing in a brand new landscape you're going from B to C to B2B you have to understand National advertising versus local it's a it's a totally different game right um and it's tough to give you like what is the right path because you can win at all three but I would say that I wouldn't downplay the amount of people that you help with your current business because how many employees do you employ right now who now like enjoy their jobs because you you know have a good setup for them and you encourage them and you know you give them career advancement
(10:55) and how many people get time back in their lives because you take care of their landscaping for you so they can do other things they can be with their kids be with their families whatever it is right so I think I think um it's a short-term long-term thing right now this feels shiny and new to like pursue this other thing because it's money that's right here but um I had a I had a a business owner who had a single location who approached me four four-ish years ago uh and he was a similar position as you and I advised him against doing um what you were kind of outlining uh and the main reason was I
(11:25) just said well how much does it cost to open a new location and he was like I don't know like 40 or 50 Grand and I was like okay well how much do they make he's like I don't know 300 400,000 in profit and I was like okay well we should just run that play as much as humanly possible and forget about the whole like licensing thing and now that company is a a behemoth is a nine figure business now four years later uh with hundreds of employees that help thousands of families tens of thousands of families every single year and so I
(11:55) think that you can think just as big as you want in any of these vehicles and you currently already have paid down the ignorance tax of what you're currently doing like you're just getting to the point where you're starting to make money and doing a good job with it when it gets boring is usually when you need to go harder right like when it gets so easy right that you're like I could do this with my eyes closed when you can do it with your eyes closed that's when you 10x it right rather than say okay now this is easy I'm gonna go I'm gonna go
(12:19) hit myself in the [ __ ] head and try and try to learn something new because I'm an entreprene and I just like like making my life hard but boring is where you get rich like location location you know how many locations you got now um so it's just one centralized crew of four four full-time guys and then one project manager and it just one of the biggest bottom necks with it is just it takes a lot of capital and skilled labor to do you know what I do which is kind of like you know expert landscape design
(12:47) with insulation landscape you know just a little bit more Niche landscaping area without going too much into detail so I just think it' be harder to scale compared to giving the framework that I used over the last four years of all that information similar what you did with gyms to other business owners that are struggling because there's tons of guys in the business that are under a million per year that they're just struggling and I really think i' like to help those guys because I've helped people in my you know in my area just giving them tips and they're like man this tip really helped and you know like
(13:17) dou with my leads you know all this things so I have the information it's just that's what I'm really really struggling with you know it's a short-term long-term thing man like it's ABS so I'll say this you gotta pick where you want the difficulty in terms of scaling right like the the the doing the the tips and tricks and selling those and whatnot very easy to make quick money very hard to make huge money the the difficulties that you have right now the good news is that once you overcome those difficulties you then can
(13:48) scale and whatever whatever monsters you have to slay onest and building uh Coastal creation right to uh something really big the person you is going have to slay the same dragon and if it's really easy for you to just do this other thing it's really easy for someone else to do it too and so a lot of people see hardship and scaling as some somehow a bad thing but they're just also called Moes or competitive barriers that other people would have to overcome and so I'll just rewind this to like if you want to make a shitload of money in terms of build
(14:20) huge Enterprise Value the thing and like ultimately sell a business then you want to go private ownership or you want to go a franchise route if you want to just make income then by all means you can sell information it has high margins and you can do it that way but it's very difficult to make it recurring um it's very difficult to turn that into an Enterprise it's very easy to make it into a high income generating thing but you will give yourself a job that pays well most likely and that's what most
(14:44) people who are in that space have gotcha okay well yeah I know there's like seven people behind me trying to ask for questions so I'll uh you so don't worry there's a hundred other people who had the same question as you who that that served so you're good man thanks so much Jo I appreciate it I appreciate you Alex thanks man 100% Alex how's it going good man what's up I'm great thanks man I really appreciate that you take the time to answer my question um I speak of goals not in terms of achieving specific
(15:17) things like making x amount of dollars but more of a goal for the business life you know uh imagine you don't really know what you want to do but maybe you know what you don't want to do sure how to set the riot under quotes goals is it simply the opposite of what you don't want I think it's a wonderful way to start because if you uh I mean Charlie Monger said all I wish I could do is know where I'm going to die and just never go there obviously you know rest in peace to Charly but um I think it's it's a wonderful exercise because sometimes trying to figure out what you want is really really hard but a lot of people know really clearly what they
(15:52) don't want and you can go you can approach the process through elimination and then once you eliminate everything what's left over you can again what are all the things I don't like about what's left over and you eliminate more until eventually you're left with things that you're like you know this isn't bad and then you look up you know two years from now and you're like you know what I kind of like my life um and from a business life perspective uh just for me personally that that's very much the path that I followed um I looked back at
(16:16) the last few years of my life and was like okay what were the good days what were the bad days I said what were the common things that happen on my bad days okay how do I not do that stuff and then what were the common things that happened on my good days well how do I do more of that and over the last few years I've just try to engineer my days to just be as many of the good things in a row as I can um I had a mentor way back or like 10 12 years ago um and I had had a particularly good weekend and
(16:40) I went into work and uh I said yeah I said this great weekend and she said something really insightful and she's like I'm pretty sure the key to happiness is stringing as many days in a row like that as you can and it was just such a simple operationalized way of just seeing um living a more enjoyable life um that I took that to heart and so that's kind of how I've approached it and I you know for a very long time kind of lived by the whole [ __ ] happiness Mantra uh which is like I just I don't care I'm going to do things and I'm going to be useful to society um
(17:08) independent of whether I enjoy it or not but um in my lack of pursuit of it um a few years ago I was on a podcast and somebody asked me like are you happy and I thought to myself I was like you know what I used to introduce myself as like hey I'm not the happiness guy like don't listen to me for that but I can help you make more money um but I enjoy my life a lot now um which is you know almost a surprise to me as it might be anybody else um but I actually really like my life um but it it it it wasn't that was never really the goal I just tried to avoid things I hated for the most part
(17:37) and then when everything that I hated was gone I kind of liked what was left okay maybe one side note on on this I know you are talking a lot about um you you don't have to find your passion but you can create your passion by doing things U to get good at it uh to be then passionate about it um but for for for my opposite uh example from from before um if if there are not two planes where there is an one opposite maybe this is a kind of a sphere or something where there are several opposites um you have
(18:07) to as you said maybe um eliminate one after the other until you find the opposite of it you know so because I I opened the question when uh with because I said um when you don't know what you do it's a good thing in general um oh it's a bad thing and but if you if you what you don't want yeah then it's a good thing and there's maybe an opposite of it but maybe there is not just one opposite maybe there are a bunch of opposites if this is some kind of a sphere you know um and where how to find the the right opposite of yeah I think you can cross out many paths yes and so the way that I think
(18:49) about this is um I think about it more directionally then I think about it in terms of the perfect pick and so I think one of the big fallacies of Entrepreneurship is that we're going to pick right the first time and it's going to be perfect and the reality is that you don't have the context from which to make the Judgment because you don't have enough information because you haven't done any of them and so it makes it's it's a ridiculous hope to think that you're going to pick right on the first time it's really just like hoping you win the lottery like of course like of course you have no idea you've never done it right and so um I think about it
(19:16) in in the in the most basic terms it's like okay do I like Words more do I like numbers more it's like oh I like numbers more cool well I can just cross out all the stuff that has to do with words now of the numbers careers what are all the industries that are promly numbers or career paths within those okay well there's data analyst there's media buying there's conversion optimization like these are all things that are very metric driven okay well which of these well cro stuff is is a little bit marketing and numbers okay well I don't
(19:40) really like marketing stuff okay what about finance and numbers okay I kind of like that okay cool then you can start and then all of a sudden you just you just cut out huge tranches now at some point you take the jump and you're like well I'm just going to jump into here and what ends up happening is that you learn a ton of skills in that first career path or first jump or first business whatever it is but here's the part that I think people mess up is is that they think that if if you spend two years they're like man I spent two years doing this job or career or business
(20:03) that I didn't like and they think that somehow wasted when really all you did was gain more information and I I tell I mean a lot of people know the story from Steve Jobs he took a class in calligraphy right which made absolutely no sense it's which is just writing like how you write whatever handwriting and years later when he came out with the uh Mac it was the reason they had fonts was because he took a class in calligraphy years earlier and so if you follow the quote perfect path you're not going to have these little side quests that create kind of the nuance and the depth of your understanding and the different
(20:35) perspectives that you can take to a job or a career or a a business and so for me like I came into the gym world with a space cyber and intelligence background from military Consulting right so like it had nothing to do with that but the thing is is that I approached I learned a lot of skills at that position that I was able to apply to the gym and so I was able to look at the gym business a little bit differently than I think a lot of other gym owners did and so so that gave me an advantage and so it wasn't that I wasted those two years it
(21:01) was just part of the path and so I think that a lot of people really hard on themselves and think that you need to have the perfect pick but life is long and it's about acquiring the skills along the way and even if something isn't the perfect fit you learn more about what you don't like you cut that stuff out and you lean more towards the stuff you do and that's it because the only reason that you have this Rush is because you think you need to get somewhere but you don't you're going to die everyone ends in the same place uh may you give may you give you a
(21:26) little bit of context um I started computer science and started uh my business as a freelancer it's a classical pth uh it was obvious somehow then I moved towards being an agency I hired people and took over projects um but when I asked myself uh where do I want to be in five years the answer was total different I want to help people to grow somehow okay I couldn't really see this by being an agency okay um at least not in the way I wanted to be so I pivoted recently I shut down my small agency after two years okay currently I'm helping five software Freelancers okay some like people like me to Build a
(22:02) Better Business throughout my learnings I do this for free um your first book inspired me a lot um but this I hope to find out uh what my product or service can be and also finally to find my goal my business goal you know is this roughly how you would approach it like test measure I'm gonna pull two parts two things from that real quick so one and this isn't to make you feel bad about the decision that you made but the that you couldn't help people while owning an agency I think was was wrong um because you absolutely could have made the lives of every person that worked for you better and so it's really just like how you choose to Chunk Up the
(22:38) goal because like you can absolutely make the five or 10 people that work for you every day have amazing lives and you can have a deep impact on 10 people's life that can last forever right and their families and their kids and so forth so I just want to put that out there just because you're not the only person who thinks this who's thought that thought now with regards to where you're currently at um I would think about you did different things with your agency there were probably some things that you weren't good at there probably some things that you were great at I
(23:02) would just get really specific on the things that you were great at and then if there if there's elements of implementation around those things that you can help them do some done with you or done for you service around that then do that in exchange for money you know what I mean um and you can make the content around that and don't be afraid of like giving away the secrets it's never the issue because you know a good uh a good friend of mine Neil Patel if you know who he is um he is NE patel.
(23:24) com it's a they they serve Fortune 100 companies for SEO and so he gives away all the secrets of doing SEO and I've I've we've talked about it and he's like oh I I give I give I literally have tutorials and everything that we do he's like but no one wants to do it so they just hire us and so like everyone has this fear that like you're gonna give it's like it's a lot of work no one wants to work and so if you can just give people a shortcut even if you explain all the Nuance of the entire process people just trust you more and then when they do come to you they're coming with clear expectations because
(23:55) it's like hey have you consumed my stuff they're like yeah it's like that's what we're going to do cool great and so I think just get hypers specific on the things that you were really good at within your agency and don't pretend to be good at things that you weren't because you're gonna have you're going to be um tempted to do that because some of the people might start getting into the running into the obstacles that you ran into and then look for you for help and don't make [ __ ] up because that's where you get in
(24:19) trouble so what that would then do is say hey I don't know I struggle with this too but I'll bring in people who I knew did a really good job with this and then we'll learn together and then can you can document that stuff so I'll give you an example when I had my gyms um I wasn't very good at at at at keeping customers now I mean like I wasn't terrible at it but I would never have said I was a churn specialist I wasn't really good at like super all ltu but I was so good at the marketing and sales side and making the business profitable overall but like I had probably industry average turn now when I had gym launch
(24:49) and I had access to thousands of gyms I was like hey who here has super low turn and has had low turn for six months and so I had 20 guys out of a thousand who raised their hands so the top top Point 2% came up and I was like okay so I interviewed all of them and found out what every single one of them did now all of them had a list of a hundred things that they were doing but they all did five things so five things all of them did and so then I took those five things I standardized it and then I gave
(25:14) it to 10 gyms that were s that were sucking at churn and I said do these five things and let's see if your churn improves and then their churn improved by a lot and then I gave it to another 10 gyms and their turn improved by a lot and I was like okay now I can feel confident and I can State the facts and tell the truth that Say Hey I was not an expert at this so I found the answers out and this is what happened to the gyms that we did it with use it if you want and so I would just approach it from that perspective and don't flaunt
(25:36) or pretend like you know something you don't wherever you got stuck but for you you've got the software guys get hypers specific on the stuff you're good at help them with that stuff either in a done with you or done for you model and I think you'll be fine yeah great input many thanks for this uh and for your time Alex and I consume really uh everything literally you put out there uh all the time it's always mind-blowing so really a big thank you well thank you so much for coming on I appreciate it have a good
(26:05) one Alex imagine someone you know achieves every dream and hits every goal they have years later they get old and die two years later how much do you care about as much as everyone else will if you accomplish your goals and dreams do it for you you know um I mean this has kind of been my mood going into this call today to be honest with you um so I told I told Jason who's behind the camera I was like you know it's going to be a weird day on goals because I'm gon be like what does it matter you know we
(26:38) all we all end up six six feet below the ground anyways but I think uh the opposite side of that coin is um all of the reasons that we tell ourselves why we shouldn't go after big things are completely irrelevant after we die and the people's opinions that we're afraid of they too die and and so if people live on past us they don't think about us and if people don't live on past us they're dead anyways and so the idea that we would spend our entire lives catering to people who will never think about us again feels like a damn shame
(27:14) and so um I think the constant reminder for me that I'm going to die and that I will be forgotten and that the goals and achievements that I have are irrelevant help me go after bigger things because it makes life worth living for me in the meantime hey Alex how's it going is it a thief it's a thief nice what's up man how's it going good good good just wanted to say that I'm really grateful for being on this platform having the opportunity to ask questions directly to you and um once again if my energy is a bit low like I live in Dubai so it's
(27:52) like 2:30 a.m. in the morning in the morning right now how can I help so yeah so getting straight to the point um often times in the past I've set ambitious goals for myself you know like big goals for myself but to hit these goals I've burnt myself out which resulted in me not hitting my next set of goals sure and I start going in this mindset of like hey sometimes things that you love don't always love you back okay and in your personal opinion how do you balance between like ambitious goal setting with the risk of getting burnt out and what strategies would you recommend for
(28:26) maintaining motivation over a long period of time for to help with that yeah I think I think u i mean it's a good question and it's it's a common one um and so I see that as a common struggle so it's not a it's not a bad thing um just know that you're not alone with it you know I was the reason you get burnt out is because you're in a rush like that's it like you're in a rush because if you if you said I have to achieve that goal by the the time I die you wouldn't burn out right and so it's only based on an arbitrary expectation that you set for yourself so like you are burning yourself out like
(29:08) no one else is like you choosing to set a goal like if I said I need to be a billionaire tomorrow I I I could work around the clock and I probably wouldn't be a billionaire tomorrow was it a bad goal well yeah but it was really more that it was a bad timeline more than anything now the flip side is people ask me well once you hit a billion then what are like are you going to are you going to retire you going to do something it's like well no then people ask that about 100 and I was like and once I get to a billion it'll be 10 billion because it doesn't really matter what the goal is it's just who I want to
(29:41) become along the way and the work that I want to do on a daily basis and so I don't think you would burn out if you said I will commit to doing these things and independent of whether or not the goal happens what I care about is progress and so so if you said I need to be a millionaire in 12 months well the math says that only one out of every 200 people is a millionaire like in the OR sorry makes a million dollars a year excuse me um it's it's less than that for millionaires um but also that takes into account that many of those people are 70 uh and so they've probably lived longer than you right and so you know I
(30:20) think in the US uh the top 1% income is 650,000 a year right now that's top 1% right and so to set a goal that like I will be in the top 1% in 12 months I mean you can set that goal it also just doesn't matter like that goal is irrelevant like why not six months why not six seconds it like it's it just it's completely arbitrary like you make it up and then you stress yourself out and to to try and hit it right but if you said what activities would make it unreasonable that I don't make progress and if you do those activities
(30:50) on a long enough time Rison you will you will hit your goal and surpass it but the thing is is like real real is the goal just like doesn't matter like the goal is the activities that you do because the work is the only thing that matters in the long run like the work you do like the work is the goal and like if there's if there's one message that I could I could [ __ ] get out there to everybody is that a large part of My Success has been that every year I get closer and closer to what my ideal is which is that the work is the goal like that's it it's not the work is
(31:22) the goal so that the winning takes care of itself it's not we go to practice and then the score takes care of itself because even by saying and the score takes care of itself or and the goals happen anyways we still make the goals King but if you make the work King as in your dedication to doing excellent work whenever you do it because that's who you are and who you choose to be and you don't put out subpar stuff because you would know it it channels into a different a different level of energy like I don't burn out I don't think I ever will burn out it's not like and like for everybody who follows like I'm not a high energy
(31:54) guy you know I mean like I'm like there's some guys I see like that guy just doesn't stop like I stop all the time right but I'll endure because I keep my commitments like it's probably one of the only things I do is I keep my commitments and so if you if you dedicate yourself to Excellence overall because that's an ideal that matters to you that's an ideal that matters to me it might not be you but like whatever whatever your ideal is then you can live every day of your life in pursuit of that ideal knowing that you will fall short of perfection but still trying to make
(32:25) progress towards it and so even if one day you don't work because you're [ __ ] exhausted it's not like well I might as well eat pizza because I didn't work out today it's like no I'll have a slice and I'll work out tomorrow and then I'll do it again and this this you know this month I I worked out 13 times the next month I'm GNA try to work out 16 rather than saying oh I fell off my workout routine this month I burned out it's just progress right and so I think about what are the activities that I
(32:50) will commit to and you do have to have some sort of realistic thing like you have to you have to pay rent you have to eat food you have to make some sort of money of course but am I is it reasonable that I'm making progress because at the end of let's say this year if you go from whatever you're making to let's say it's I don't need to know what it is but let's just say it's a $100,000 a year and by the end of the year you make $200,000 a year but you met you set your goal at a million are you a failure maybe you chose to make yourself a failure if you want to if you want to
(33:17) be a failure you can choose you can choose to make yourself a failure you can also choose to make yourself a success right and so because then if you look at that like well if I keep doing that for another year I might be at 400,000 and I had I had my neighbor uh Jacob years ago he was 15 years old I said what do you want to do he's like dude I just want to make money that's what he said I said if I could have you sign a contract that you make no money for the next 10 years but then you're a millionaire guaranteed 10 years from now
(33:41) would you sign it and he said yes and I say cool you're not living your life that way and so a lot of people say they would sign it but then they turn around and then don't they they act like they have to be a millionaire in 90 days and then it takes them 10 years to realize that it was never going to happen and they had to slow and steady proc progress it just looks like it's fast from the outside because that's how social media portrays it people don't get popular until they get big but just no one sees the early 10 years you know
(34:07) what I mean and so all that to say commit to the activities that you will do and then look at the outputs of those activities and as long as you're making progress and you have a feedback loop of how do I get better how do I get better how do I get better you will win on a long enough time Horizon but the reality is like the win the w you move it anyways like as soon as you hit a million you'll set the goal at two million it like it's irrelevant it just doesn't matter but what will matter is the type of person you come along the way because that person can't be taken from you they can take your
(34:38) money they can't take who you are got it got it thank you so much Alex for the information itself you know like um obviously a lot of people listen to this listen to this as well right so all my friends like whether it's Daniel bass or even um Alex himself like I'm really grateful for this opportunity right now thank you so much oh you bet man appreciate you thanks for coming on Alex Maxwell how you doing owner of Rosen Crown what's up yeah yeah it's my agency I've started the agency like about six years ago it's been a wild ride cool what kind of agency uh we do
(35:23) um SEO and website content marketing cool for small business um typically like contractors and homebuilt design Like Home Services got it cool yeah yeah um I know this is about goals so I'm gonna I'm going to start it off with a little quote you might have heard is a dream written down with a date becomes a goal sure a goal broken down into steps becomes a plan and a plan backed by consistent action becomes reality so that's a big thing that I live my life by is creating this sort of a goal ladder sure and my question for you is like how
(36:00) do you track your goals do you do um you know I I use the bullet Journal method I don't know if you've heard of that before but that's how I can like track my progress for individual goals as well as business goals it's a great question and I think that my answer will surprise you um I don't I don't really track uh many goals um I haven't really goals down um much in a while I mean we have company goals and things like that but those usually get broken down by department and when I had a smaller business um I didn't I didn't really
(36:38) write them down that much um and so I would I applaud you you're probably doing something much smarter than than I did um but I will say that I spent I spent an inordinate amount of my time trying to figure out what the one thing that I can do that will make all the rest of the things not matter or be irrelevant and so like if there's one problem that that I can solve that makes all the other problems go away I try and focus on that and so like a few years ago I was like man all these billionaire you know overnight billion dollar companies are getting spawned by people
(37:09) building big personal Brands and so I was like well then I'll just do that and so here we are right and so I I thought like I try and think of like what is the one what is the one chess move I can make that makes the rest of this stuff irrelevant and so then I just ruthlessly dedicate myself to doing activities that I think that'll achieve that and then just get better along the way yeah yeah no I I feel you on that um what do you if you don't mind me asking what do you think because I've already I've been on a couple podcasts talking about this and I have an interesting like perspective
(37:40) on it but like when AI chat gbt this stuff kind of Hit the hit the ground hard uh last year I kind of saw the writing on the wall that agencies in general are going to go through like a massive consolidation and um I think that in three years maybe five but I maybe less than maybe like three years like a college kid is going to have one software that kind of does everything and they'll be able to out compete most agencies you know down in LA or up here in Santa Barbara what do you think about that I think that there's really only
(38:17) two modes of humanity there's humans plus tools and tools basically as long as humans compete against humans you're fine because that college kid is going to have the same access as you will and so as long as we are competing against other humans I'm not really that concerned because they'll have tools I'll have tools we'll both use tools to our advantage like all humans have since the dawn of time the moment that it's humans against machines machines win and so but once humans are against machines to me that's kind of like doesn't really
(38:48) matter we're gonna lose and so we just hope for the best that they like us um but I don't just be really real like I don't spend a lot of time worrying about it because what am I going to do about it right there's nothing that like what what is going to change about my behavior nothing and so until that day comes I will equip myself as I always have trying to best prepare use the tools that are available try and leverage those things so we can get more out of them than other people can try and adopt technology faster than my competitors do yeah but if there ever is a you know a trump Car Technology that comes out there well then that questions
(39:18) the meaning of life overall and it's you know humans against machines and you know money doesn't matter and you know it's guns and gasoline or who knows right but like yeah I I just again I I go all the way down there and then I'm like well what am i g to do today I'm probably gonna make content that I said I was gonna make I'm gonna write the book that I said I was gonna write I'm gonna take these calls I'm make these investment decisions and that's what I'm gonna do so that I I don't I don't stress about it I'll just put it that way I don't stress about it I think it's
(39:42) easy to spin yourself up because then you get into this existential threat but you'll probably do what you've always done which is you'll adapt yeah yeah and I I did adapt so what we started doing last year which is funny because when I read your book and I've been watching a lot of your things you kind of hit the nail on the head on what we did with Rosen Crown which is we basically positioned ourselves as like Consulting agents like a Consulting agency and what we do is we train an in-house individual right to do everything that we do using
(40:10) the software that we do and then we just charge monly for that yeah put yourself out of business I love it it's great yeah yeah so that's basically my solution but yeah that was pretty much it man well awesome dude well thanks for coming on I appreciate it you yeah have a good one all right see you brother work plus big goals equals ambition lazy plus big goals equals entitlement big goals don't make you different big work does you know it's funny because like a lot of people it's funny I mean this is
(40:42) this is obviously a whole day on goals but a lot of people have big goals like that doesn't really mean very much it's just what what are you doing about it and when I see somebody who has huge goals and isn't doing anything about it it's just like they feel like they deserve a big life like you don't get a big Life by just wanting it like everyone wants it everyone wants a six-pack everyone wants a beautiful wife or a beautiful spouse or whatever everyone wants a big business but that doesn't change anything like your desire changes nothing and claiming and like I hate I
(41:13) hate hate the all the deservingness worthy Mantra that is pedal by the internet because they want to tickle people's ears and make them feel good about themselves like it does nothing and so a lot of people I mean I try and boil everything down to behavior which is what are you going to do and basically Nothing Else Matters like all the words that people use to describe their emotions to describe X Y and Z like it just doesn't matter until you translate it into activity like what are you going to change about your behavior even when we're talking about the AI thing earlier it's like well what are you going to change about our Behavior if we're not going to change
(41:53) anything about Behavior then then talking about it doesn't serve us right and so having big goals is fine but I would just say like it's honestly it's fine it just doesn't matter like like if someone comes to me like the amount of times I I I have conversations like this people like I want to be a billionaire I want to help a billion lives and I'm like cool man that's awesome what are you doing about it like it's just easy to say I had a gym owner once who's like I want to help 10 million people get fit and I was like no you don't you have a
(42:21) local gym you don't want to help 10 million if you did want to help 10 million people you would you would go about completely differently like you say that because people around you nod their heads and you sound you feel good when people say that's great that's why you keep saying it because you get reinforced by other people when you say it not because you actually [ __ ] want to do that because it just comes down to what you're going to do and so all day long all of that ladders up to activity and so if you don't know how you spend your time in terms of what you do then I can promise you that you're not going to get where you want to
(43:00) go anyways the deservingness worthiness Mantra just it just like manifestation I just I hate all of it I just think it's just it's complete gobbley gck it's just it's make belief it just it's not it's not a thing like I can stand here and just wish for a mill it's literally wishing it's just saying if you keep wishing for it if you keep wishing for it it'll come the univer like as though the universe gives a [ __ ] about you right the universe is going to deal you something because we have one itis we think we're the center of it it's like it doesn't matter but I actually think
(43:29) that's really comforting because it means that you can not be worthy at all you can not be deserving you can be an absolute [ __ ] you can be a [ __ ] with three fingers and like looking like this and can't speak English and it doesn't matter because if you still do the stuff that gets you what you want you still get it and to me that is the ultimate equalizer if more people find out about your stuff more people will buy if you make your offer better more people will buy and so do those things the rest of it leave leave the manifestation and the worthiness and the deservingness and the
(44:01) affirmations and the self-love and whatever the [ __ ] else leave that to your competition and while you stomp on their necks as you just move past them because you're focusing on doing more and doing better of what has worked in the past then you'll get on podcast and say you know I just always dreamed this way and I just W I'm just kidding um anyways that's my little rant for that moment hi Stephanie hey Alex so nice to be with you here and what you just said is the reason I follow you um love what you do I love your podcast um and I I
(44:36) love the fact that you're on LinkedIn now your little tidbits of information um I am probably not your typical follower so I work in nonprofit uh but I I do my entire job is around helping business owners so I'm around business owners and entrepreneurs all the time and I do dabble in um businesses myself in my spare time um so my question is around um it's more General so it's around um just being a person who has always has some goals um whether they're learning so um just learning new things so learning goals um fitness goals as well as um growing businesses um not
(45:28) specifically my own but helping um friends and um others to grow their businesses and my my question is like around how um I I'm pretty aggressive about um having all those goals and like how do I not alienate um the people around me and keep like the quality of those relationships when I'm like go go go and people are telling me to slow down or take it easy um yeah so that's that's my first question before I answer what do you think I'm gonna say uh leave those people behind yeah yeah the thing is is like um you
(46:20) can't be like you can't be all things to all people right like they have their dream for what they want Stephanie to be like to them and you have your dream of what you want Stephanie to be like and what you're coming up against is the conflict between those two ideas and so they want you to behave a certain way and that behavior they're basically demanding from you and when you don't act that way they punish you verbally they avoid you they they send messages whatever it is right they passively aggressively make comments whatever it is and so like as you level
(46:52) up people either come with you or they fall off and so I mean I tend to be binary when it comes to either someone is helping me achieve basically helping me become the person that I want to become or they're hindering me and I just don't have room in my life for people who aren't helping me right and so um I think it's really admirable that you're helping a lot of businesses with the nonprofit and the things that you're doing um and you have these goals and so often times people get a lot of anxiety so I Define anxiety by having um
(47:24) many many plans but few priorities and so you have lots of things that you want to do but you don't know which one to do and that's what creates anxiety right just like I'm not sure which way to go right the equal opposite of that is sadness where you just don't know any path because you don't see any option whatsoever and so it's a very different feeling and so if you feel that way it just means you need to make an order you have to Force rank say what is most important to me and everything else comes second to that and if you can't like you have have to make
(47:56) that order for yourself because it gives you Clarity and once you have Clarity then you can make decisions around an outcome like this is what I want and when I say for me from an outcome perspective I really think inputs and outputs like you said you have a fitness goal you have a learning goal you have a business goal right I boil all of those down to inputs and outputs the same reason I started this thing with saying like our way of doing goals is we say what's the input what's the output and so Fitness the input is probably going to be like I need to go to the gym and lift weights or do cardio whatever it is
(48:22) right X days a week cool that's my input whether I get in shape not there's I'm not getting into like nutrition all that stuff but like like that's that's that input right my learning goal is that I want to read three books now I would boil that down probably another level because a lot of people mentally masturbate when they read and listen to podcast but I say I want to be able to take something actionable from this book and I'm going to do something about it and so from every book I want to do one thing I'm gonna take one piece of action
(48:46) or I until I take action I'm not going to read another book and so I actually don't read nearly as many books as people think I do um because I just try and take action on them because my definition of learning is same condition new behavior and so if I'm in the same condition and I haven't changed my behavior I haven't learned anything and so this book is really just the same as watching a movie if I don't change how I act and so I would make sure that my my inputs after reading the book have changed so that I can demonstrate that I have learned and when it comes down to
(49:12) the the businesses I would make sure that you boil things down also for them you can use this Frame if you're kind of Consulting helping I'm not sure how the nonprofit Works um it's to like what are the inputs and outputs of the business because every business is just a pipeline at its most at its most basic form there's something that comes in and there's and there's money that comes out and so what is the input that has the the highest uh return on our effort and time and capital or money and so a lot
(49:37) of times people don't even know what the activities they do they make money on accident and I can promise you they'll make a hell lot more money if they do it on purpose and so it's like yeah you know we they a lot of people just spray and pray they do a lot of different things but they don't actually know that 90% of their sales come from one channel you're like cool well what if we 10x that and then forget everything else because we make that a priority and so the the big picture is that strategy is just a fancy
(50:02) dork word for priorities it's all it is so when somebody says like what's your strategy just means what things are you prioritizing over others and it's taking the limited resources we have in time and money and effort against unlimited options because there's a there's countless things we can do but there's limited things that we should do and that's strategy and so back to the original point of like you've got people who aren't encouraging you [ __ ] them you already know that right well I like what you uh told one of the previous guys
(50:36) where you said work is the goal so I think for me that's what it is right I just want to work um so yeah so I love that I I wrote it down so Alex one of these businesses I'm helping is a gym um so what is your advice on like right now let's say around like 70 members um smaller gym like what's your um one piece of advice to like double it and then go big honestly the the simple answer is I wrote an entire book on how to grow a gym so I would say like read that book read that yeah I recently started um following you so I you know I
(51:14) haven't um read that so yeah just just read that book like you'll have more than one way to double the gym like it's just the business has not changed it hasn't changed in in 50 years um it's a very simple business the thing that makes it harder is people it's a very service heavy business it's one of the you know there's a handful of businesses out there that are that the what you make a profit on is the quality of the service that you provide which basically makes it a training and culture business which is why it's so difficult to scale relative compared to like a food business like you can have low skilled
(51:43) labor that doesn't have you know tremendous skill and you can keep opening locations and making sandwiches but when you have like a massage thing like it really comes down to the massuse it come Downs to the trainers it comes down like that's why hair salons oftentimes like there's not a huge hair salon chain why is that because it's so dependent on the individual stylists right and so that's what makes the business easy to start with a single location guy who really loves what he does uh more difficult to scale because it takes a lot of systems and operations specifically around training and
(52:12) recruiting okay but if they have 70 members they're in the same spot that most gyms are at which they're probably breaking even and the owners making $30,000 a year take come and working 80 hours a week um they just need to promote more and they have to fix their pricing I'd bet that those 70 members what what's the price I'm getting a little tactical but what's the price that they're charging um like around $30 a class for an hour right okay so it's a class it's a class based thing yeah um they they they have to make more money per they have to make a lot more money
(52:42) so they have to charge more add additional Services um that add value they have to be reaching out to every customer on a on a bi-weekly Cadence to check in with them just because they pretend they care um like there's just just read the book read the book and do the things in the book I will um thank you so much I like I said I love what you do and I also love to listen to Leila's stuff so oh yeah she's way better people just don't know you yeah thank you so much for having me thank you Stephanie for coming on I appreciate
(53:16) it Kenny you're muted just FYI thanks Alex employee entrepreneur that's great it's where I'm you're good for the Hest too far um so for a bit of context here I've got achievements and like I've achieved goals in other areas of my life up to this point mostly academics and Athletics um I'm realizing now a lot of those goals were external not really set by me um consciously or unconsciously so in terms of setting my own goals now um I mean everyone wants to dream bigger that's already come up so in business how do you balance the Continuum
(54:07) between what if this could turn out way better than you expected and be realistic when you're formalizing your goals well dude I honestly don't think it matters either way like I I genuinely that that's just right off the bat like you I'm going to rewind and give you a little Kudos because I think you you you might need to hear it but the fact that you had the achievements in your career and you were an athlete before this it actually gives you a pretty big leg up on most people because um a lot of times athletes are accustomed to working for very long
(54:39) periods of time without reward before achieving a goal they're accustomed to the idea of years upon years to develop skills that that take Mastery business is the same way and so if you can TR if you can generalize that approach to skill Mastery within Sports and how you worked uh with within team and having a coach if you can if you can apply that same perspective to business you'll Crush you'll do great you'll go way ahead way faster than most people because you've actually done a lot of other work that people have to do later ahead of time so I just don't want you to feel like you're at a disadvantage or
(55:10) anything like that because like a lot of your backgrounds actually prepared you really well for the entrepreneurial path so just like point one you should know that um in terms of realistic versus big goals dude like you're you don't it it's kind of like it's kind of like a a take this way I mean it like a little bit of a mental masturbation exercise of like how big could this get or like I just want to be realistic like it just doesn't matter like rational design I think is complete like a complete farce like no one's like it's kind of like Mike Tyson's thing of uh
(55:39) you know everyone has a plan till they get punched in the face and like the market will definitely [ __ ] hit you in the face and so as much time as you spend the day you get in the ring all of it's going to change and so I would just encourage you to not spend too much time in this phase because it doesn't matter it's complete make belief like I have never made a business plan in my entire life I just know like okay well this costs this much I think I could charge this much let me see if I can let people know about it and if they want to buy it
(56:04) that's it like that's bit like you just sell something to someone and that means you're in business like a lot of people really over complicated it's like you have a service you do something that saves someone time or effort and you charge them a premium on your time in order to do it because you have some skill that they don't or some time that they don't or you have some sort of product that you developed that I mean developed sounds super fancy like it you know it could be whatever it could be a food thing it could be a workout thing
(56:28) it doesn't matter right you develop a product you know what it costs you buy a little bit more in bulk so you save and then you have a markup and you sell it over time you develop a brand because you make content around it that shows why your thing is superior and whatever lifestyle and things that you want to associate your products with that other people who want to associate themselves with those values will also choose to vote with their dollars by buying your product that they say that these values matter to them that's all it is and so
(56:53) there's all this [ __ ] that makes business really complicated but like the like for you it's like dude just sell something it doesn't matter I would actually rather you just make a sale on anything just to show yourself that you can just get through all the first steps which is like get the LLC set up get a payment processor set up get the bank account set up and then like go ask strangers for money I'm dead serious serious as cancer man like that's all you have to do there's all this [ __ ] that's like between your ears and you seem like a nice guy this is me
(57:27) just like you know picking up whatever I'm picking down like speculation like no you see like dude you you will win if you if you just if you if you stop thinking about it I promise you like way Dumber people who are worse with other human beings than you have won in business like you can do it you really can like I'm just saying like just off of just like the tiny interaction I have with you I mean it did sales for a very long time so like Split Second interactions like decent decent judge of initial character you'll be fine dude
(57:59) just have you have you read the leads book yeah yeah okay do the warm Outreach section do the rule of 100 and either just pick whether you want to sell your time at some sort of service to solve problems for people or you want to sell a product that's it and if you don't have Capital just start with a service and you sell your own time that's it that's all you got to do if you've read the offers book make a really good offer message 100 people that you know you already have a thousand people you know right now on your phone you can do this tomorrow you can set up your LLC bank
(58:29) account and payment processor today that's crazy I love how you yeah you simplify everything so everyone else complicates it it's always been the simple everyone else just [ __ ] complicates it it's all it is that's my goal for you just do those things and don't care about whether the goal is realistic or unrealistic do that make money and then all of a sudden you have a way better perspective on how this works because it's like right now okay let I'm gonna give you an analogy because I think it might be helpful so what sports
(59:00) did you play uh iy ice hockey okay so imagine you've got like a like a 10-year-old kid right and he's never skated before all right and he's like you know I've got these goals between you know um becoming a a high school coach and and and going pro and I'm just debating on you know what I should really set my goal for my ice hockey career you'd be like dude [ __ ] get on the ice like you don't even know how to skate yet what are we talking about right like you'd probably be like this is ridiculous and so it's the same it's the same perspective right like I think
(59:39) you're spending all this time on the side of the ring and you just got to put your skates on to get in and then you're gonna get hit on your first game be like [ __ ] that hurt wow I can't do what I thought because like he's on the sideline trying to come up with plays for how he's going to play Ice Hockey and he's never even he's never even been in a game yet I promise you you'll win though if you actually do this stuff you'll win you'll be fine yeah that that makes sense thank you second question you have these goals now and
(1:00:12) you're in that first stage you're in your lonely chapter how do you create that external accountability to to get to these goals when really you're just by yourself dude you know external accountability what's the thing you're most afraid of cool uh yeah losing my house okay you don't want to lose your house right right then don't lose your house I don't think you need any more external accountability like I didn't want to go home a failure that's all it was like that was my external accountability every time I wanted to quit I was like I can't go home a failure I'll never I I will [ __ ] hate myself for the rest of
(1:00:56) my life I won't do it I can't do it and so losing your house is probably a very painful idea so you're working right now the good news is that you only have to work 2,000 hours a year there's another 6,800 hours that you can you can put towards that more of your time you're not working so just use some of those hours do the rule of 100 and then make as soon as you make as much or more than you currently make at your job do it for six months save up save up a nut all that extra cash don't spend any of it put it in a bank account and then feel you'll feel good about getting the other the other 40 hours 50 hours a week
(1:01:28) back because then you'll just make more but you just got to make are you married I'm married yeah yeah so just you just got to set and I'm saying this to Kenny's wife because you can play this recording to her um you got to give Kenny space for this like you have to you got to let him do this and it's going to be a short-term sacrifice but longterm if he doesn't do this he's going to resent that you never gave him the the the space right because long term if if if she doesn't support you I'm not saying she does or doesn't I'm just saying but like if she doesn't support you longterm in taking this season because this will be a season the thing is the season might last six
(1:02:01) months it might Last 5 Years and I know that's a big ask but at the same time she probably loves you because she wants you to be happy and she wants you to realize your fullest potential and if you're unhappy in your current thing and you feel unfulfilled and you have this hole that you just can't [ __ ] like every day you get in bed and you're like I hate what I'm doing or I don't want to do this I think I can do more you have these feelings and you're just sitting there at night like you don't want that
(1:02:25) but I promise you you don't have those thoughts when you're [ __ ] exhausted because you worked a double every single day because you did your job and then you started working on your career now again be more be more purposeful with the time you're probably have less chill time less Netflix and relaxing and probably be more strategic and be like okay let's make sure the hours we have count let's do stuff or let's let's make sure that I carve out this time but then it's like that's it like I'm gonna spend the rest of our time so that five years
(1:02:48) from now we can do whatever we want whenever we want and I'm just ask but she's gonna make this bet with you right does she have a career she does yeah okay well then you have even more safety now so you're fine as long yeah dude you you can't lose if you actually do it if you actually do what I just said you will be fine apprciate that thanks much back Kenny you got it man thanks for coming on when I started going after bigger goals I found it more useful to write down what I was going to give up more
(1:03:24) than what I was going to do and in general the bigger the goal the bigger the sacrifice so I actually think this is is is a second frame that um is super useful so one earlier on um I think Peter referenced uh if you don't know what you want to do figure out all the stuff you don't want to do and cross all those things out first another way of thinking about this from a goal setting perspective is like you need to do these activities but right now you currently spend every minute of your day not doing
(1:03:49) what you need to be doing and so what I mean by that is if you've been plateaued in your business at the same level for six months or 12 months or more and you spend all of your time working then you're doing the wrong stuff and so it means that you can't add more to your plate before you take away and so I remember there was this time when I had six locations and I was planning to get to 10 and I realized that what I was like what I needed to give up because I needed more time in order to do that and so I realized for
(1:04:17) me I was going to give up uh the Ravens I'm from Baltimore uh I know sad sad loss recently um but I gave up watching and following football because you know there's obviously the watching football but then all of the ancillary stuff around it like the commentators and like who's coming up this week and what are the matchups and how are the other teams doing and how are the players doing and fantasy and all that stuff so I gave that up and I gave up basically all the social interactions that I had around that with friends because a lot of them that was like the main thing that we
(1:04:42) interacted on um and I gave up uh Netflix because I used to watch Netflix now I watch Netflix now because I'm a different season but during that season of kind of grind time I gave that up too and I remember making this video um I just went Facebook live and no one gave a [ __ ] because I was just a kid who owned a couple gyms um but I was like I just realized that like I have to give these things up that I love and it was because I loved the thing that I wanted more and so I think um rather than trying because like right now a lot of people maybe are taking notes or they're
(1:05:14) like man there's some activities I need to be doing you can't add them to a plate that's full you have to clear space like you have to clear space and that mean and and usually when you clear space it hurts because it's stuff you like doing and that's and that's natural it's normal but the thing is it's it's a it's a short-term pain for a long-term gain or the alternative is you continue to suffer the same long-term pain that you are while having these short-term hits of gain right you the short-term pleasures of fantasy football of Netflix of of whatever you know the show you
(1:05:44) follow or whatever your hobby is right we do these things but we sacrifice the big thing that matters most to us and I think that that's what leaves a lot of people feeling empty like if you if you look back on the last month or or quarter or a year and you think of all the hours that you spent on these activities that don't really ladder up to anything like they don't help you get forward or make progress towards the ultimate goal that you have and when I say ultimate goal for me it's still very much like the person you want to become and the ultimate potential you want to realize
(1:06:13) if if those things haven't laded up to that you probably don't even remember most of it you probably couldn't even tell me what shows you watched or or or the games that that played and like did it really matter right and so again you might love football maybe that's really important to you whatever it is but like if you're not willing to give those things up then just be able to say I did not hit my goal and realize my potential because of the Ravens and when you say like that it makes you feel like a [ __ ] or makes it
(1:06:40) made me feel like a [ __ ] and I was like well I'm not GNA let the Ravens stop me from you know realizing what I mean they're a great team and I love you know I love I love supporting and I like having the you know the friends that I can talk about it with but if I can't talk to my friends about anything besides the Ravens are are they really my friends and so I would you have to eliminate before you can add and sometimes it hurts and that's okay hey is it Karen or Kuran it's Quran kurran there we go nice to meet you I'm
(1:07:14) a big fan of your and Lea's work and like it is so exciting to be here and it's bit shy to be in front of so many people and um so yeah my question was about uh goals so I'm more or less in the same situation as the I think Danny what's most his name uh employee entrepreneur and Kenny I'm sorry Kenny so I'm still trying to figure out my way and so I have a lot of goals and I'm very easily distracted yeah so what would be your suggestion like if I don't have any um sales or business skills but I still I'm in the want prer phase and I I want to Chase my goals so what would
(1:07:56) be your best advice for that yeah well there's there's kind of two paths that you can are you employed right now or no I'm currently unemployed now okay so there's there's kind of two paths that I would I would I would consider strongly so one is that I would try and work for a small business owner and the reason I would say small business owner rather than a big business owner or a corporation is because in a small business you're going to get to touch all the different aspects of business because there's just not that many employees and you can spend your extra time trying to learn
(1:08:26) from the other people who do those functions so every small business is going to have some element of marketing they're going to have some element of sales they're going to have some element of product or service or customer support they're going to have all these elements and so if you go there you can go with the full intention to learn and just get paid to do it which I think is a wonderful way and I think a wildly underutilized way for people who are kind of like not sure what to do go work for some businesses that you think you might want to start later it's the best
(1:08:48) way to learn like I quit my consulting job I didn't start a gym immediately I went and I I worked for minimum wage I was a consultant I was you know like I I made a I made a good living I was a Vanderbilt's very good school and highly ranked in the US and um I went from a a prestigious consulting job White Collar doing space arban intelligence uh to mopping gym floors right but I did that because I wanted I had no intention of staying mopping gym floors I wanted to learn the ropes I want to learn how it
(1:09:17) worked and so I worked at the gym I was there 16 hours a day I got there at 4: when the when the the owner got there and he would leave at 4: so he'd work 12 and then I would I would keep working till the gym closed because I wanted to I want to know what the trainers were doing I wanted to know what the what the the billing person was doing I wanted to know how the sales worked I wanted to know how the marketing worked and so that's what I did and I honestly the way I did is I emailed 40 different gym owners because I wanted to get in the gym business and only one of them got back to me and he off he said I could
(1:09:41) work for him and so I drove out and I wor and I drove out there with my car and packed up and that was all I had and I started working for him the next day for minimum wage right he called me his Apprentice right and so so like there are there are a lot of paths and if you if you feel like you have absolutely zero knowledge you'll probably learn a lot faster just getting into a business and getting a feel for it and getting paid to do it so that's the good it's like you'll get paid to do it just be
(1:10:06) willing to take a pay cut that's the thing is everyone has this big ego about like what they should what they deserve I'm worth this it's like no you're not you're not right you're worth what the Market's willing to pay and if the Market's not willing to pay that then you're worth less and that's fine as long as you don't think that that's your worth that's your worth in this season which is you're getting paid to be a student everyone else pays to be a student you get paid to be student what what a wonderful life right so I think that's path one now path two is if you
(1:10:29) had because if you had said I am an employee I'm making you know I'm making money now I would have said okay learn as much as you can from the business that you're in if you like that business and then take all the excess cash and invest it in courses skills and when I say this stuff because a lot of people are like what courses BL it's not about that like there's so much free information on the internet you can you can immediately use that stuff and deploy it but there's still costs of learning and so what I mean by that is like if you if you want to you you want
(1:10:54) to start a school Community like there's a cost right you you want to start a website Shopify cost money like you want to like all these things but the thing is the cost of starting those things or start the cost of running your first ads it costs money but you learn and so you take the cash that you have and you deploy it against those things right and if you're like [ __ ] I really suck at ads then sure maybe pay someone for tutoring that's what I did I literally paid a guy who was a media buyer one of these agency owners and I just said hey how
(1:11:18) much do I have to pay you an hour he Tred to be 750 an hour I didn't have that kind of money and so I was the best [ __ ] student in the world I sat there I recorded everything I took all the notes and I did everything he said and within six weeks I could run ads like him and so like you can learn this stuff quick if you just take the notes and you apply yourself and you're willing to risk some money and bet on yourself but tldr if you're unemployed right now and you want to get into the business game figure out what business you want to get in at least generally go to a small business I would say 10 employees or
(1:11:43) less and then say I will I I'll hustle I'll work everything and I'll commit two years I'll give you 24 months of the absolute best effort ever and I and I'll eat dog [ __ ] in terms of what um willing to make if you're willing to make the trade that and you don't even have to say this explicitly like I didn't say hey Sam I want to learn everything from you I was just like I just want to I just want to learn and most business owners want people who want to learn of course because they want you to get
(1:12:06) better because if you're better then you make them more money right and then take your extra time be friendly to all the other employees and most people take them out to lunch have zoom call meetings with them see if you can if you can help them and then they'll help you and they'll teach you what they do like this is how I've learned everything just nice to people I try and do a favor for them then I ask them if they can show me what they do it's all I've done just for a very long time okay so in a nut chill just get tied basically yeah in the short term
(1:12:37) just remember like it's not it's not a loss though it's not like you you failed as an entrepreneur this is just a step I was an employee first too it's not it's not like not like you're failing it's just like you expand the time Horizon and see that you have to develop these skills and just think okay I have to develop these skills that's the principle that I have to accomplish how many different ways can I do that if you you don't have the means right now because you have to like eat and pay rent then go get employment at something in the industry that you're interested in ideally in a smaller business so that
(1:13:01) you can learn from those people and get paid to learn what a deal yeah if you put it that way that makes sense yeah I think people should put it that way yeah don't worry about your parents or your friends or what they say it doesn't matter yeah everyone thought I took dude I was I was a white collar consultant from Vanderbilt finished in three years I had above Harvard's mid score in the GMAT like had the credit and all my friends were doing really fancy consulting jobs looking way cooler than me and then when they found out I was
(1:13:31) going to become a trainer at a gym mopping floors like oh poor you he Alex you know tough tough time I'm guessing are are you Indian or you have a you have a ethnic background yeah I'm an Indian right and so I'm sure your parents are tough on you I'm guessing I'm guessing of course they are and and and good for them right they're trying to raise a good kid I get it um but they want you to win and so I'll say this as long as you work your [ __ ] ass off on a long enough time Horizon you will gain their respect
(1:14:02) back they said they're just going to measure you on this because it's all they know they're just doing the best they can with what they know but the world's changed since they were kids and since they were your age right and so it's okay to like I know this is tough man believe me the hardest decision I ever made was disobeying my father hardest decision I've ever made and quitting my job right now I think you're in the position like you can get a job that's below your pay grade my dad didn't tell anybody that I quit and started working at a gym he didn't tell any of his friends until I owned a bunch then he was okay talking about it again
(1:14:32) right otherwise his son was a failure right then he was a failure and then he's like oh my God I'm a failure right and so it's like you just have to have a longer time Horizon for your success than they do and they're ju and like don't resent them they're just doing the best they can with what they know of course they are if they love you which I'm sure they do they're just doing the best they can with what they know they might not say it well but that's what they're doing and so go work even if it's below the pay grade with the full
(1:14:55) intention of working your ass off and learning everything like rip all the knowledge from that business specifically learn the most about acquisition which is how they get customers learn that when you have that then you can go start whatever service you want and maybe you'll learn how they do whatever their services you can start your own got it that's a lot of valuable advice thank you so much you man good luck dude you'll be fine thanks long time Rising long time to win man all right Spencer Alex nice to see you how are you excellent how are you what can I
(1:15:33) do for you good uh I would love two questions but I will be happy with one um the the first one is how do you determine priority actions when you have no tangible evidence or results for which to make priority action decisions from okay for what so context wise I I do Fitness I mean I'm a coach I have been for eight years transitioned online and my main focus is in the morning I do my deep work I write long style posts I create content okay um my goal for the year is to get 750 pieces of video content out I'm just chasing that number as fast as I can and
(1:16:13) in the afternoon trying to reach out to as many people as I can before Facebook or Instagram block me from reaching people okay um when there's no real results like you know direct for me to directly say you know making this many reals or making this style of real talking on this piece of content to X number of clientele or X number of calls whatever yeah I just don't know if I'm just doing too many things and if it would be better to focus on two of those things yeah um so how long you been doing how you doing 100 reach outs a day
(1:16:49) uh just about I do I've been I've been averaging about 75 so far this year so which is short of a 100 um okay and that's the very t i so you're month in so you're month in of do it so did when did you start you started in like January 1 when did you middle of December I've been doing reach outs for quite some time I there reach outs are always the shittiest one and the hardest one because I have I I believe very little Goodwill with my audience outside of the content that I create I think most of the connections I have are not warm okay
(1:17:22) that's fine I mean that's why it's cold so like that's fine okay and then from a Content perspective you're putting out how many pieces of content a day two sometimes four uh usually two or three reals and one still type post and so from all of that you've gotten zero customers this whole I've gotten three or four this year I believe okay so in eight weeks you've gotten four customers sure yeah five five six weeks okay so five or six weeks you've gotten four customers so you're getting like a customer every 10 days roughly um actually which you know
(1:18:02) so four yeah so one every like yeah 10 10 12 days okay um dude I actually I think you're you're fine man I think you just got to get better so like you're doing you're doing the right activities you just have to go through the better Loop like right now you're like I'll bet you your opening message is probably not as good as it could be I'll bet you nurture in the conversation of like how you're doing the ACA like acknowledge what they're saying compliment them ask them the next question like that could use some work
(1:18:25) in terms of how you're actually nurturing them to like get them interested and clarifying what problem that you're trying to solve for them and then getting them to a call that you can sell them on I'm guessing that's more or less how your funnel Works essentially yeah I most of the reach outs don't lead to to anything yeah and that's okay that's I mean if you it's it's 1% like I mean it's it's a very low like it's a it's a volume game and so you're getting a customer every 10 days like if we can improve like the nice thing with outbound that I love love about this is that like you can you can double a
(1:18:56) response rate you can triple a response rate and all of a sudden every 10 days becomes every three days just from that one change and so right now do you have do you have all the metrics of that lined out I know we're getting taxed for everybody who's listening but this is how we break [ __ ] down so in terms of I get your inputs so you're putting two pieces of content out a day and you're doing your reach outs okay so do you have uh like your your next like funel metrics you have certain number of responses so are you met reaching out to people who are um like liking and
(1:19:22) commenting on on uh on the post and whatnot yes but it's always the same people and lately my content has been getting less and less engagement yeah okay so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna give you a a small piece on this is I'd rather you spend more time and make one good piece of content okay just make it good so now now you just got to make seven a week just one a day just make one good piece okay just make it better because in the content game quality does like it's kind of this this tough thing where like you have to make a lot in
(1:19:53) order to learn what people kind of like um but if you make too much you spread yourself too thin because it's just you and so quality still trumps quality trumps quantity but quantity quality trumps trumps quality on its own right you want to make lots of good [ __ ] but one good thing like one good video will make you more money than 10 mediocre shitty videos um but you only get good at making videos by doing more and that's why it's kind of like a a chicken egg issue um I do appreciate that you're getting the Reps in but D you're five or six weeks in so like I I
(1:20:24) would I would not lose steam it probably also is a little bit of an expectations thing like if you're getting a customer every your 10 days like it's not terrible like it's not it's not terrible like like all we got to do is tweak one part and then becomes every five days now you're now you're at more than one a week sure five or six has been like three years like that's since since I since I drastically increased the volume I've been coaching for several years and making content online I would say the
(1:20:49) consistency is more in the past year and a bit but the volume the volume yeah go ahead keep going um the the volume particularly recently because um I mean full transparency I just kind of hit a mental low that I just I didn't really want to be alive anymore I felt like I was just do I was the I was the success zombie that that we we talk about that you just you want the things but you don't do yeah you don't take any of your own advice andt it was it was a really cool place to be because I haven't been more excited to create than
(1:21:21) I have I think ever which fantastic so the volume I mean I I back to Kenny's example of playing hockey like I played hockey growing up too and I had a shooting cage and I took literally 50,000 shots yeah and and so that was like people I hated when people told me like man you shoot really well yeah yeah I've I've done it 50,000 times and so that's my goal with content is do double the amount and get better yes so like you're like dude you're on the path you're just early I'm being dead serious with you man like the fact that you've already got you've got like in the last whatever five or six weeks you've gotten
(1:21:51) four customers like you're you're just on like shot like 300 of your 50,000 like you'll get better I would just make sure that keep split testing the opening lines and the offer that you're actually presenting people when you're getting on the phone with them uh because that those are going to be the biggest levers you have opening message and the offer are gonna be the biggest levers that you have in outbound by by a long shot and if people aren't responding I would say give away more free [ __ ] so on that
(1:22:16) opening message see if you can just give give [ __ ] away because you need to get some traction you need to get some inflow like this is just me sensing just from like what you're saying like I would rather you have a full roster of clients that you're helping quote for free and then barely be able to take people on and then start raising the price of hey I can't I can't do this anymore for free and then start raising price on those people and asking them to pay like I'd rather you just give away more [ __ ] up front so you can get more people interested does that make sense in terms
(1:22:44) of lead magnets or in terms of working with clients because it has been years and so like I I have my bills paid with my client roster cool okay well then yeah one I mean to me one and the same there like the lead mic can just be a a shorten period of time I mean you've been through the the the the leads book I'm sure so on the lead magnet chapter it's just about like how can we just give away more [ __ ] on the front end to get people interested just keep giving stuff away until you get more people engaged and that'll that'll dramatically change your funel metrics like if I had
(1:23:12) one tldr for you like one thing to take away from this like oh two one make a little bit less content I'd rather you just make it better right rather because if you're doing the solo two to four pieces a day is [ __ ] tough and the reach outs and the client roster like that's a lot of work dude so I commend you on the work ethic drop it to one and then the second is put all the excess time into into giving away cool [ __ ] now I would say instead of giving away like free materials I don't think people are
(1:23:36) going to care a ton about that in the fitness space just speaking from my own experience I think what they will care about is free time and effort and Consulting and so that's where you can like walk some like hey I'll do free kitchen walkthr you can FaceTime me we'll walk through uh your kitchen I'll tell you what you should be eating or not eating hey we'll do a free grocery guide next time you go grocery store let's schedule the time FaceTime me I'll walk you through the store what you need to get when you need to avoid like just
(1:23:59) get a little bit more creative on the stuff you can give away on the front end just give and dude if you spend an hour with someone talking about their food or talking about grocery shopping they be like [ __ ] this was so helpful and then they're gonna there's gonna be this pause where they're like well how can I get more of this right and you're like well it's funny you ask and then you can and you say hey why don't we talk tomorrow I know you're getting in in the car we'll talk tomorrow I'll walk you through it cool and then they will show up and they're very likely to buy but just frontload on the on the on the DM
(1:24:23) because if you went through the cold outbound chapter in leads the biggest breakthrough we had was giving more [ __ ] away on on our outbound like giving front-loading more stuff to give to get people engaged especially if you're cold you got to make it insanely good for them to respond warm traffic they'll just get on the phone because they trust you but cold you got to make it worth their time and you have like this long to do it yeah those are the two takeaways one piece of content give way more [ __ ] up
(1:24:47) front thank you I I appreciate that and funny funny little idios synr there synchronicity synchronicity um you said when you give so much that people just naturally want to that's how I signed up a client today I got to the end of the call it was goingon to be a strategy call and she's like well can you do that yeah sure dude that is how marketing works so so do that just give that away but strategy calls a little bit of like people use those as sales call so like I might call it something different but
(1:25:19) just say like hey I'm going to walk you through an entire nutrition thing it's absolutely free I do it because I want to give back to the community and it helps me know people and at the end of that call if they don't like sign up for you just say hey do you have any friends who might be interested in something like this didn't do that today all good no like dude you're you're on like shot 300 of 50,000 like you're fine dude but dude you're five or six weeks in you still already got four customers like you're fine just from an expectation standpoint like you're super
(1:25:47) early thank you it it feel it feels longer because I've been at it for like for years but it's but dude you w early in the consistency aspect yeah you weren't though you know what I mean I'm only I'm only I'm only pushing on that because I don't want you to beat yourself up for it like you were you were in this industry but you weren't playing the game right like now you have now you have skills and you're playing the game you're thinking inputs you're thinking outputs you're thinking funnel metrics you weren't doing that two years ago no [ __ ] way right
(1:26:13) you're doing that now and now it's just going to go up I promise you like we're just going to keep tweaking these little aspects of the funnel and you'll be good like if you're doing one every 10 days it takes a double to get one every five days days two doubles in your every other day like you're this you're this close dude I appreciate that yep appreciate you man thanks for hopping on the bigger the goals you set the bigger the failures you get scars we collect from the monsters we've slain you know when you go after big [ __ ] um
(1:26:49) it just hurts more when you fall um and the more public you are about what you want to do the more people will jump on the bandwagon because you know people love heroes but they don't love anything more than watching a hero fail and so expect that if you start going after your goals and you start achieving them people will start looking at you differently and secretly they will start hoping that you fail because it will make them feel better about the action they have never taken and so um like I mean I I've told the story before but uh
(1:27:21) when I was sleeping on the gym floor uh a lot of my clients were like oh good for you you're pursuing your dream you know all that stuff um but then when the gym started to work and I started to make money and I started to be able to live on my own um and I had like managers and all that stuff like people like ah big man you know decided to come in oh thanks for gracing us with your own presence today you know um and it was this moment where I realized that um people believe in the American dream are root for it until it comes true and then
(1:27:45) you become the man and I don't really know when that happens but my postulate is that it happens when you pass them you go from pursuing the dream as the underdog to the man the moment you pass their level and so um some of the scars that you have aren't even from failures but they're from relationships that you thought you had that you don't uh because you realize that people weren't actually rooting for you they were making themselves feel feel better by pitying you and you thought they were rooting for you but if they were really rooting
(1:28:16) for you they'd root for you even harder when you win and it's really rare to find those people and the more you win the more you realize that like people who uh you see as friends and acquaintances actually see you as the competition and so um I would just say like if I if I could tell my my younger self that I would have just prepared myself more for that and just said like it's okay to lose friends because they weren't friends to begin with and you didn't really lose friends you expose the fact they were never friends to begin
(1:28:44) with and that being said everyone I hope you enjoyed the second episode of one of zero live um if you like this stuff drop it in the comments uh it it tells it gives us the signal that uh like we should keep doing this if you guys hate it like we won't do it anymore so definitely tell us uh it just gives us really valuable feedback um so that we can uh just help you accomplish your goals which hopefully if you got anything from to day um as long as you work uh you have achieved the goal and you become a success the moment that you
(1:29:16) decide you are and that took me a very long time to figure out so when you do the activities you are by definition being the person that does the activities which means you are realizing every day the potential that you want to have so lots of love keeping awesome and I'll catch you guys later by

Advice for Hard Days | 1/0 LIVE Episode 1 - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) despite all the hard that you're going through you just have to believe with all your heart that you're going to make it welcome to the one of zero Show episode one advice for hard days I'll be taking questions for you guys in the audience and we'll be doing this live Alex what's up what's going on man how we doing I'm rocking hey dude first and for most man I know you probably heard this a thousand times over but thank you and uh not only for doing something like this but um the impact uh that you're making on people's lives I think you probably have a number of idea of a number of lives that you're
(00:37) impacting but you could just take that and multiply it by a thousand and that's real talk big number well I appreciate it man thank you what can I help you with man uh not much man I mean I guess not much and also a lot but uh yeah no so uh I run a group and personal training gym in uh in Jersey and it's um basically our tools are kettle bells Community breath work and the focus for me is longevity and uh the one question that I had that's been brewing in my mind since I'm pretty early in my career in the sense of two years coming up on
(01:09) three years um is what's the one question that you wish you would have asked yourself earlier in your entrepreneurial career when faced with a little bit of uncertainty and Direction and I know that's probably Hefty question and like just to give you context for myself too it's like 90% of my business is in person um in terms of online that's the kind of the the direction of whether or not I really want to go towards um more specifically you know creating almost like a watify version of kettle Bell's um platform you know so it's um just
(01:54) basically just trying to figure out what the next step is going to be you know h okay so I guess me asking myself a question is always going to be different than you asking something for you because we're different people right and we have different goals and so everything usually ladds up to like what's the goal what's the why and so like right now do you have like a monetary goal do you have an impact goal and believe me I have no issues if you're like I just want to make a certain amount of money like I get that um because any of the businesses that you just mentioned so
(02:25) whether it's the brick and mortar uh business or you want to start doing training for those people online or it's doing the watify version which is basically no service and just providing workouts and whatnot um all of those are are potential businesses but pursuing all of them at the same time will virtually guarantee that you don't succeed at any of them and so the biggest issue when you're starting out is just picking the path and being willing to commit to it with the uncertainty that comes with it because
(02:51) like every entrepreneurial path has uncertainty like and that's what makes entrepreneurship hard it's literally the not knowing and the pain of suffering consequences for ignorance for things that you've learned now that you're like if I had only known then what I know now and that's every entrepreneur until the day they die and it's just wishing that it were different that causes a lot of the struggle so which of these things of the three that I just mentioned like which of those is the one that like lights you
(03:16) up the most um I mean in-person training obviously like we live in a small Beach toown Community where everybody knows everybody and it's fun it's family it's convenient I will say there's that comfort factor that in almost in one scope is very beneficial because it is so comfortable but in reality too like Comfort is the enemy of achievement and growth so it's like I know like the comfortable side is the inperson and it's the community and it's fun it's family friends whereas the uncomfortable more challenging but also very big picture-wise would be the online going
(03:50) Full Tilt that side now i' I've breached into the gap of like three day launches four day launches of you know small ticket low ticket offers but in terms of you know trying to scale and make an impact on the world yeah then the world's really big that so that's always really hard because I remember I had a we had an event with gym owners and somebody stood up I said what's your mission they're like I want to impact One Million Lives I was like do you have a birk and mortar location that has like 200 members like let's want to do that
(04:19) then you would actually just you would you you You' approach it very differently or you'd have a Time rise and that's the rest of your life right it's like one or the other if you're like I want to do that in three years you wouldn't start with a brick Mor location and so the thing is is that what you said earlier is like you you feel comfortable and it sounds like you want to grow I just want to make sure that's correct before I like absolutely okay so there there was like an underlying assumption at least that was unspoken
(04:40) and I just want to draw attention to it which was you're like the brick and mortar thing is comfortable it's family it's friendly it's fun I'm assuming it's profitable I'm assuming you're making some money doing that um the thing is is like you could like just doing more of what you're currently doing and saying like how do I open a second location or how do I you know like how do I open like five locations over the next five years or whatever whatever it is yeah that would produce probably just as much of a challenge as going online would except you already have two years of
(05:07) learnings on how to run that business where you have none in the online space yeah and so like you always just want to Stack knowledge within a specific vertical so that you just go deeper and deeper on it because that's where the compounding returns happen like the richest people that I know have been in the same space for 40 years they just know everything there is to know about the space and like that's how they've made their money and so with what you're doing like you can either open a location that's not necessarily an Beach down and test your metal and see how good you are at actually scaling a team
(05:37) you know hiring somebody else seeing if somebody else if you can actually incentivize people build a culture so that people want to work for you that you can recreate the success and that'll show you whether the success that you had was because of you or because of your ability as a as a businessman right because like you can be a charismatic razzled Dazzle dancing bear in any brick-and mortar business and it will work yeah it'll work surface with a smile always always works right and it's just hard to scale because most people don't care as much as owners do but if you can create the model that has the
(06:06) incentives and the training in place and the and the procedures that can consistently create that five out of five experience that allow a second location to have the same amount of success as your first location then you have something that absolutely can scale and create lots of Enterprise Value over time so I would say either scale that or basically dial down your inperson to as little as humanely possible of your time and then go in on the online thing but uh trying to do both will be very hard because what'll happen is you'll start to do some online stuff you'll start to
(06:38) subtraction your gym will start going down but that's your main source of income then you'll hop back to the gym the online will dip and you'll go back and forth and so that's why I'm so big on just committing to whatever thing is because any of them would work but you just have to be all in on it yeah and I know we're running out of time but I guess on that point too it's like the one pillar that I guess I failed to mention was the freedom and flexibility this being a seasonal town and do the other thing and haven't gone
(07:02) to the gym for a year then maybe you'll do the you'll do a second gym and so I think no matter what path you do this is probably perfect end for this which is you either are going to do the online thing after you figure out how to Outsource the gym or delegate it and hire people who are awesome or you decide you're going to do a second um location either way you're gonna have to start with Outsourcing the first gym that's two STS one two stone or two birds one stone yeah appreciate you AJ appreciate you Bo keep doing it
(07:36) later hey Alex what's up how do you say your name hod hod yeah pretty good how are you doing good man good good so uh first of all really appreciate the uh chance that you uh gave me uh this is this means a lot to me um so I'll just jump into into the question so um let's say I um I want to start a business okay and um there are I can have a very Grand Vision of the business so like apple or Microsoft they they had this vision of like changing the whole world okay um but but I also can have a vision of just just
(08:25) making enough money for me to survive and just work on my thing um let's for now assume that I've that I've chosen the Grand Vision one okay um how so the the real question here is how do we keep working on this business for years when we're worried that it might get outdated because of a new AI or a technology or in other words what do we do when we think our project might not be useful in the long run I mean what you're talking about is strategy like these are strategic decisions that we have to make like you make a big bet on where you think the market is going
(09:04) to be not where it is today if you're going to go after something that's that big but do do you have investors right now uh no I'm I'm a entrepreneur if you you say that then let's let's bring this back down to earth all right just for just for your own sake um if you look at the companies that you just referenced right like you look at basos with Amazon you look at you know Zuckerberg you look at Microsoft every one of those guys started well off and well capitalized okay so basos was a investment banker from Wall Street Bill Gates parents were really well off and he was well off and whatnot Zuckerberg
(09:43) went to Harvard same deal and so like I you if you want to really go after that you would have to try and recreate the conditions and I think that right now the likelihood that that happens given your current situation is low and I'm not saying that to dissuade you I'm saying because I want to be realistic with you which is that you need to get your own head above water because like right now if you're if you don't have the ability to make money on your own right from a entrepreneurial perspective like you need to get your head above water because the only way that you could stick with something for the required amount of time in order for it
(10:13) to become world changing like we're not talking even a decade I mean those companies they're you know 20 Facebook's 20 something years old right just like context and so the only way to get there uh is be able to breathe while you're going and so I think that from a a one-on-one perspective starting starting a simple business that you can generate income on that you know you can you can learn the basics of business before trying to take on the biggest competitors in the most well- capitalized Arena absolutely on your own I
(10:43) see not to say that that's impossible it's just incredibly improbable given the the circumstances that you just laid out okay it would be really romantic for me to be like dude go chase your dreams go do that but like I also would rather have you in a year making money on your your own so that you can breathe because you might find out that if you actually start making money on your own you might just like that because right now it's just the idea of the status of the dream that like it's an amorphous idea but the amount of pain and suffering that you have to be able to put up with and not make money through that whole period of
(11:13) time really tough okay but but wouldn't that uh wouldn't that cause another issue where because you you decide to choose a pro choose to solve a problem that is small like smaller than the grand Vision uh then you won't be able to scale much that's not necessarily true and also every one of those companies starts small like Facebook wasn't like we want to be the social media platform for the whole world he wanted to map colleges yeah they s they start with a niche and then they expand outwards and so you want to much more narrowly Define
(11:47) your problem before you go attack it because what you're going to try and do is build something that's going to be everything for everyone and it's gonna be nothing for nobody I see you are strategy is prioritization it's allocating limited resources against unlimited options and so you have unlimited options but you have very limited resources and so in order to be successful you have to narrow the problem that you're trying to solve so you can allocate the small amount of resources you have to adequately solve that problem completely and then from adequately solving that problem completely like Amazon started
(12:17) with books and Facebook started with colleges right you solve and then you can go adjacent right so right now it just sounds exciting to say this but like it's not reality you have to pick one problem that you're gonna get really good at solving and that's it and then you can have an idea that in the future but real real so many things are going to change between now and then and there's so much luck that that that has to concur because if you think about this zooming all the way out the biggest companies in the world have super well
(12:41) capitalized people who are the best in the world made a good call and had luck because if you're number one you have all the things plus luck like if you're number one at like in the whole world it's all of it plus luck the market moves in a direction that M that you never know right and so I I would rather you just stick to a problem that you know you can absolutely solve given the resources you have learn the skills make income and then from there you can go solve an adjacent problem or you might decide you know what I like this and I'm gonna keep going with it I see thank you very much that's that
(13:14) was really awesome thank you than good luck man you too thank you all right so this is our first uh tweet break interruption or not Interruption just tweet tweet tweet Central um you're going to lose sleep you'll doubt whether it'll work you'll stress to make ends meet you won't finish your to-do list you wonder if you made the right call and have no way to know for years this is what hard feels like and that's okay um when I was tweeting that I was thinking to myself about I think it was just stuff that I
(13:51) was going through at the moment so if you guys don't know like my tweets actually just they're not they're not ghost ridden they're just me and they come throughout the day like right before I got here uh Jason grabbed my phone I was like wait I got to tweet this something just came on my head um and I think I think I was just just trying because a lot of people say like entrepreneurship is hard but I was like it's such a it's such a vague term I was like what what about it makes it difficult and the the thing that I keep
(14:14) coming back to that makes entrepreneurship difficult is that you have a known cost for an unknown payoff you know every day that you're continuing to pay these bills both in time energy money all of it every day you're paying this bill right but you don't get the paycheck back you don't get the reward back and sometimes it's a week sometimes it's a month sometimes it's a year and sometimes more realistically it's years plural before you get the paycheck back and the paycheck isn't always money sometimes it's just knowing that the thing you said was going to happen happens or that maybe your wife looks at you a different
(14:45) way or maybe it's your your family that looks at you different way you want status with with your community whatever it is um whatever that thing is that paycheck that you're working for figuratively um and it just comes down to this absolute Soul crushing uncertainty with the idea that no one can actually tell you and you have this this unquenched desire to be able to predict the future while at the same time knowing that you can and you have this desire because every day you learn something and then you look back at a year from a year a year ago and you're like why the hell did I not know this
(15:14) like I'm such an idiot it feels like I'm starting all over again today because of what I just recently learned all the work that I did up to this point is useless but that's the wrong way to see it because like you are the work that you've been working on entire time and the fact that you can see what you were doing before was not nearly as fruitful as it could have been is the progress that you are making and so like trying to consistently reframe that for myself has been uh really powerful in getting through harder
(15:45) times Jimmy let's go to the next one DJ oh my gosh hi you're amazing I can't believe I'm talking to you thank you socome yes I love you um I do like I had to get that out I love you back yes so I run a writing company I write for celebrities and CEOs because I took your advice and I started writing for people that have more money and it's oh gosh yes um but I also publish my own books and I traditionally published with Publishers and I've done really well but in the future going forward I want to publish my own book self-publish my own
(16:28) book because that's just it's it's necessary right yeah but I have analysis paralysis because there's so many options to execute a strategy sometimes I don't know which option to pick to just execute the strategy for my next book and my first goal is just to sell a thousand ebook copies not nothing even Grand yeah okay then when I settle on a strategy I get scared because I don't know if it's going to work like when I set on oh I'm just going to use like clickfunnels and D then I'm like oh but I don't know if it's going to work and then right and then I'm back into the same place the
(17:04) hard times place and then I do nothing yeah understood so two questions real quick so when you say you have so many different strategy you can pick from you're talking about different topics for the book is that what you're saying no so I know the book topic but different options to execute a plan so I could use Quick clickfunnels to execute a plan to sell a thousand s yeah just selling it yeah just selling the Thousand copies that's that that's my goal I want to be able to sell a thousand copies for my next self-published book have you read the
(17:29) book yet have you written the book yet no but the book will be that's the easy part okay I'm a writer so that's the easy part okay okay okay um because I was like I'm like the book's the hard part selling's the easy part um opposite problem for me yeah no understood okay so um you you want to have a guarantee you're asking the world for a guarantee you're asking yeah you're asking the universe for a guarantee that it will never give you yes and you're waiting for a response in order to move forward from a universe that stays silent yep
(18:05) right and so you're just talking to dead people um and waiting for a response so like um the thing is the person you should be talking to is the marketplace because they will always respond like when you knock they will open the door and they will tell you to off or they you open the door and they'll tell you they'll let you in but either way they'll open the door right um and so I mean let's play this out the other way what are you afraid of because like you seem very upbeat and you see like obviously you've written
(18:34) this you've written stuff before yeah a lot of tons not worried about your writing skill given what you've said so far so like what are you afraid of okay so let's let's play it out so let's say you you have your book and you pick path one it doesn't matter what it is pick path one okay so what so what happens so you put it on Amazon you're like I'm just gonna put it on Amazon and see what happens all right that's the easy path okay then what yeah I'm I'm scared that I won't reach my number I'm scared that fail at
(18:59) the goal and then then what happens I I mean I'll survive but but then I still won't know how to do it like and and I'm also scared because I have self-published a couple books in the past that didn't reach my goal okay and I know that feels like I don't want to feel like that again yeah so let me so let me do this then let's reframe this because I have a lot of experience with setting goals right so I feel pretty confident talk about the topic especially big goals make the big goals that you set things
(19:31) that you can absolutely control like you cannot control how many people buy your book but you can control the amount of actions that you're willing to take that make it unreasonable that you don't sell a thousand copies and so then you can judge how successful you were by how much you adhered to the actions that you committed to and so if I were to say you have to sell 10,000 books not a thousand books 10,000 books you have to or you lose your life in 12 months you just die that's it you die what would you do knock on every door okay okay like
(20:08) you're thinking about it right like you have the leads book right there all there's eight different ways to advertise yeah right and so you know that the more people find out about your stuff the more people buy it and there's only four things you can do right you can talk to people 10 one you can make content you can run ads yeah right where you get other Affiliates you can get referrals once they read your book or you can get agencies or can get employees to help you out that's what you got yes okay and so if you know that you have to take those
(20:31) actions then wouldn't success be so let's play this out a year let's say that you did absolutely everything on the plan like your plan of advertising of letting people know about it for a year and you did everything and you sold 999 bucks would you consider it a failure no that would be a win okay now if you sold 90 books that what's crazy is that it's just a number no I know but I just want to reframe this because the honestly the thing that you're talking about is something that so many people deal with and it's because you want to control things you
(21:09) want to control the outcome and you're saying I'm only willing to pay this price if there's this outcome but you're seeing the outcome as the outcome rather than the skills that you develop along the way as the outcome because I can promise you this this will not be the the last book you write right and so if you get to a hundred sales instead of a thousand then what's going to happen realistically is that you will figure out the one thing or two things that actually work to sell books and then I'll say do a hundred times more of that and you can either choose to do that on this book or you can choose to do it on
(21:39) the next book but the idea of like I have I'm setting this thous because you could have set a million books it doesn't really matter you're just setting it you're making up a number and saying this I feel is reasonable for me yeah instead of making the number reasonable make the actions that would lead to that the reason like what can you commit to four hours a day of promotion yeah okay then make that the commitment and I will if you do that every day one at the end of the year you will feel accomplished because you actually did what you said you were gonna do that the marketplace will also
(22:10) always recognize someone who puts four hours of work every single day into one thing yeah and that you can control right don't do my best do as required that's right might not be good enough that that's true man that was amazing just what I needed thank you good just promise me that you'll actually just commit to doing the work yes if you do that you do like I have to get sell 10,000 books what would I actually do to do that yeah find somebody who has an audience that is relative to the topics that you're talking about out to that now it's okay if I got one person they sold 20 books
(22:49) okay how do I reach out to a thousand people all have my audience if you do that you'll probably sell more than a thousand books but you just got to do it four hours every day okay cool yes thank you thank you I love you you're the best you're man love you good luck with the book appreciate it what's up hey Alex how are you doing good man nice hat thank you I like it quite a lot look felt oh my God it's the best hat for the gym good so what's up man awesome man so I have two topics that I kind of want to you know trade with you and you know you titled this advice for hard days and
(23:36) it's been it's been tough lately uh so I'm just going to catch you up on a little a couple of things that are happening so right about three months ago uh my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer two months ago uh my girlfriend the the girl that I T I was going to marry kind of left and then two weeks ago uh I traveled to London to speak at Europe's biggest business event and on the first day of my arrival my granddad passed away and so uh I had to basically uh speak in front of thousands of people and keep my smile and and then travel back and burry him did so yesterday I I
(24:16) did I did I did all of it and so the question is well you know yesterday everything just kind of hit me because now I'm back in the office and I'm taking the calls and I'm trying to deal with everything but the question is how do I maintain my composure and kind of stay strong right because it's it's a tough period totally well first off I'm sorry that you're going through that um that being said honestly you've got a lot of good stuff going for you so this is a I feel like almost a relatively easier one for me to take given what you
(24:45) just said okay like you just asked a question how do I do something I've already done before which is you got in front of a thousands of people and gave a presentation and had a smile and you crushed it despite the fact that you had other circumstances right yeah and so you ask the question how do I do something that I already done you've already done it yeah like what you're saying is how do I how do I keep living and you keep living by keeping living it's the same thing with breakups right it's like I I've heard this quote and I I heard it from Lila I think the first time like
(25:21) the amount of time it takes you get over someone do you know how long it is's it doesn't matter it depends there's a great math equation for it you'll love it it's exactly as long as you decide it takes yeah and what I'm going to say is going to sound really dark right now so I want you to take this the right way take it the way I mean it right which is that you just had you had three deaths right you had death of a life that you thought you were GNA have with a girlfriend and then you had the death of uh two different grandparents right you three deaths but wow uh on the positive sides
(25:54) my my grandmother is still battling with it oh okay she's still B wait we're we're plus one all right so only two deaths now right but sure we can even play it out all right on a long enough time riseon she will eventually pass away right it's going to happen yeah and the thing is is that you are already standing it like you're asking how do I stand it but you are standing here already like you are evidence to the fact you are you you talking to me today is evidence of the success that you're asking for you're already one dude you're showing up and you're working every day you're coming here to ask questions to actually still trying to grow yourself
(26:39) like the the stuff that you go through become the stories that you will someday tell and no one likes epic Heroes without Epic monsters and so you have to go through the rocky cut scene you have to have those periods of time where you doubt yourself or everyone else doubts yourself where the walls are crumbling around you because have you ever read shoe dog fil night story about Nike even if you haven't the the entire story is just him getting kicked in the nuts for 30 years it's the whole story and then
(27:02) he's like oh yeah then I built Nike right and now if he had just said yeah um I started this company and everyone loved it and all my suppliers were on time and I just scaled straight and as the money came in I just bought more inventory and then we just went public no one would care because it's not relatable and the thing is is that when you die the only thing that will remain is the story that people will tell of you and so wouldn't you want that to be an epic story yeah and so the things that you're going through are required for the person you
(27:33) want to be and for the goals that you have and how you are acting in the present already proves the thing that you're claiming that you want so you're already W dude and you're G to just stand it by tomorrow you're going to wake up and you're go to work and the next day you're going to wake up and go to work and then you're going to text and it's going to say that your grandmother's cancer is getting worse and what are you going to do you're going to get back to work work you're just going to keep doing the stuff like there's no there's no magic bullet you just keep going because
(28:06) either you keep going or you die yeah and if you don't die you succeeded got it just don't judge yourself on how you feel judge yourself by what you do despite how you feel so you can feel shitty you can wake up and have a terrible day and still show up with a smile in front of the thousand people and so if you can do it with a thousand people you can do it with one and that first one is the person that looks at you in the mirror in the morning if you can do it for them you can do it for you got it got it yeah well that that
(28:46) was kind of like the the Life part and and now when it comes to business I just have a real quick question okay uh so I've built an Instagram audience to over 100,000 I speak about sales and marketing I've been doing it for the past two years I've been posting kind of like every day I know the content game but the one thing that I'm struggling to balance is you know how you say give give give until they ask and you know I love it but sometimes you know it takes a while until they ask right and cash flow still
(29:18) needs to come in and I run h a service based uh business and so how do I balance it out without tiring my audience because I so my community is known for you know really being in the comments chatting with me and being there for me so how do I do it that balance line so if you want to have a one step away from like just giving forever right is that you you give in public sell in private which is when people respond to your stories right when people DM you like those are conversations that they're usually asking or they're like they're basically
(29:52) ask when people ask questions there you can't still Define a scope and say hey like at a certain point I have like I've given you all this value use all the free stuff if you want more than that I'd be happy to hop on a call and see if I can help you more right so it's not it's not like everyone buy this thing right now right you're not you're not like getting super aggressive about you still publicly just keep pumping all the Goodwill in the value that you are and that'll grow your audience and increase Goodwill and all those things that's what you want you're G to keep doing
(30:18) that it's just that you could still have a call to action that's just in the in the in the comment section or put a story up that says hey by the way if you need help with that thing um I'm happy to help like those are those are very light touch things because I understand you got to pay bills I understand that and so you can put those things out without necessarily damaging the Goodwill that I think you're that you're that you're obviously building yeah that was that was kind of like the the one thing that that I had in mind well I don't want to take more of your time but that was fantastic yeah
(30:50) irresistible yeah so good if saying no I got it 100 million offers that's right thank you I appreciate you man you're fantastic you are too man hang in there you'll be fine you'll get through it and then it'll be a story that you'll someday tell yeah and thank you for everything that you do not just for me but for everyone else because I think you're marking A New Path uh and that's that's kind of cool I appreciate you brother thank you all right if you have your back against the wall and you have nothing left it also means you have nothing to
(31:29) lose and that makes a very dangerous person which is why there will always be room for the underdog you know I think this is really interesting um because I think I tweeted this because someone had recently commented or said or I saw YouTube comment where someone was like I don't have anything uh there's why is there even a point to this like why even bother because I don't have any of the advantages or whatever of XYZ person so there's a couple directions to take that so if you're one of these people and I'll throw this out there like right now if I were to say Hey wen't you
(31:59) succeeding the way you want to right you would insert whatever excuses you have you're like my mom doesn't help me or I did I wasn't born in the right neighborhood or I'm born across the country whatever it is right the natural response to that question is okay you're right you will never succeed now what well we got to do something right right so here we are again back to doing something right because it doesn't matter like the all the reasons that we give don't matter because they're they only change your behavior in so far as you allow them to stop you from doing things and so the
(32:33) laws of action and consequence will always preside and so you can do stuff even if you don't deserve it even if you were born in the wrong neighborhood with the wrong people and still get the thing that doing the action gets you right and the interesting thing to me is that the people who have the least also have the least to lose which makes them the most dangerous competitors because as soon as you have something you become more RIS averse you can't take the same gambl like I don't take the same G G now as I
(32:58) did when I started why because I have something to lose right but if you have nothing to lose then it's basically like life giving you uh a scratch off lottery ticket and you saying you don't want to scratch it off because you don't want to lose but they're giving you the lottery ticket for free because what happens you get the lottery ticket and you lose and where are you just as poor and still having nothing just like you did before but in that one ticket out of 20 or 100 or a thousand tickets which is phone calls reaching outs knocking on doors sending cold emails whatever that lot
(33:27) ticket is you can get one yes and it can change your life and so it's like why would you not take the lottery ticket and so it's interesting because a lot of people want the yes but they aren't willing to pay the price for yes because the price for yes is a 100 Nos and as soon as you are willing to get the 100 NOS you can get as many yeses as you damn well please what's up it's a man the myth the legend Alex man the legend black tank looks nice what's up oh thanks man I have to copy you over here I don't look as jacked as you so on that good
(34:18) Li all right so my question is basically I've been online fitness coach for the last like three years now and like even progressing from like the first 10K month like three years ago like 25k a month a couple months ago I kind of felt like I got loner the more successful I got even though I do have a pretty big audience now like over one million followers acrosser got yeah so across Facebook YouTube Tik Tok and Instagram itself like it just maybe you went through something that something like that or
(34:48) maybe you haven't in that sense I was just wondering like maybe how you got over that self-limiting belief because I feel like that's kind of holding me back I want to make sure that I'm I want to clearly understand your question so you're saying that being lonely is the thing that is holding you back well it was more like I know Lifestyle Changes oh obviously you're going to lose friends along the way the conversation is a lot different in that sense but just like especially from going in person and being a full-time in person training and going line top of that just like a lot more lonely kind in
(35:20) a lot of different aspects of losing that kind of touch you just need you just have to join a community man like just straight up like you just need you just need to get around people doing the same thing as you and so that might mean physically moving to a different area because right now I'm assuming online pay like pays your bills correct yeah right so if online pays your bills then you can literally be anywhere in the world and so if you where you live right now I'm Emon Alberta I'm planning to move to Colona it's more of like a fitness town in
(35:48) Canada in like two months time like that big reason because I know more Fitness people doing out there so I feel like that would be a big help to you I would do that and I would also join a bunch of online communities of people who are like trying to make money in the fitness space because you'll find a ton of other people who were doing the same thing as you that are on the path that are ahead of you that're the same as you that are behind you and you you get a little bit of some some fulfillment from helping
(36:13) out some of the people behind you but you can also get help from the people ahead of you um who are you know because you show that you'll you'll execute and you'll do what they say um and you'll and you'll grow but this is the nice news is that this problem is super solved like you just got to get around people and you got to be willing to rejected yeah it's just like friend sales it's the same thing just go you go you go on a bunch of dates they're just friend dates you know go hang out go get a lift in I mean it's Fitness so like just go ask a bunch of people to get a lift in and you'll see who's cool and you'll see who isn't worst
(36:43) case yeah have you ever kind of experienced that as you kind of leveled up and leveled up I know of course but as long as you keep growing this is not going to stop you're going to find new friends and if you keep growing you'll pass them and then you'll find new friends that are above them and you'll pass them and you'll just keep going um and so it just depends on how like what you see the role of friends as in your life and so you know for me I just want my requirement for friend isn't necessarily that they make the
(37:12) same or more money than me at all is do they make me better do they make me better do they have my best intentions in all just already two incredibly difficult things to pass but if someone passes both those things then they are a friend and so I would just use that as a limit test like is this person making me better and do they have my best you know incentive at heart yeah and how is making friends I guess now because obviously you're a higher level and things are different with social status and all that vers
(37:43) four is probably different so do you kind of have the same standards now kind of like what is what is it kind of like dude it's harder for me than it is for you yeah um no for real it is but the thing is is that I most of the my closest friends don't live here like don't live in the same physical area that I do most of the closest friends that I have live all over and so I see most of my friends once or twice a year and that's it and I work in the meantime the thing is is that like the higher up you go here like and I'll just tell you something like from My Level whatever you want to call that um all
(38:19) the friends I have everyone complet like there is zero social obligations for anything like none and if I don't respond to text for 3 days there is zero drama it's not even acknowledged it's just we know that busy people understand that busy people are doing and so if everyone you have everyone who's who's in your world understands that you're trying to take this hill then if they're truly your friend then they want you to take the hill more than they want you to respond to their text or come out with them for the like I just got invited to a 7-Day
(38:51) thing that um with a with a couple friend that LE and I both really really adore um but we'll probably not be able to do it because we have so much stuff that we were that we're doing at that same time and I really want to go but I also really want to do this other stuff and I know that I will feel worse about myself if I don't have this other stuff done and so we're gonna say that I can't go and that's going to be it and they're not going to hold it against me and so until you find friends who are 100% aligned with you achieving your goals who are making you better and you
(39:24) goals then you just keep looking but the thing is like everybody goes period that you're at like I think I I think I made I wrote a tweet about this but like there is this lonely period that always happens when you start growing because it happens is that you're too big for the old friend group but you're not quite big enough for the group that you want to get into right so you kind of have this path in the Middle where you just kind of like keep trudging along but like every single person who's accomplished anything material has been in your exact same
(39:52) shoes and you just keep going and you keep going you keep networking you enter you go into the communities you see the people who are adding value to those communities and you message them you find the givers because givers recognize givers almost immediately you can see the people who are always giving more above and beyond and you can understand they get the game and so like in that first meeting if they're like like let me see if I can do this for you let me like take care of this for you let me help you in this way rather than like hey could you help me with this like wrong person but if you
(40:22) just start by giving to a whole bunch of people who are where you want to be you'll get more back even if nine out of 10 don't give you anything back okay that was very helpful over there especially I mean with the community side of moving definitely kind helps and just giving to those groups and those are kind of people especially want to kind be around if you give out a lot publicly the people who message you privately will be people who recognize what you were providing and so like be loud provide shitloads of value people will message
(40:51) you and then be like hey let's hop on a zoom let's grab a zoom lunch whatever and so like you can have a ton of friends dates or whatever that you meet people and see if they have game and if they have game then you keep in touch because you're making them better too yeah you also said that pretty much all your friends are kind of around the world I know it's a little different itself you kind of feel like you almost lose a little bit of that Personal Touch then or no of course it's just a trade it's a trade so it's like if you're willing to make the trade then I mean like I'll put
(41:21) it this way if that were the price that you had to pay to live the life that you want to live would you pay it that you just have friends that you meet up with once a month yes then that's just the price tag and those are the Nikes you can pay the 500 or not but that's the price tag all right appreciate everything you bet brother you kill the content Game Change it's amazing got see fly everything down spinge all your stuff keep it up bro I appreciate it man thank you we rolling this Tuesday hey Alex how's it going all right tell me how do I say your name
(42:08) celesi oh that's easy celesi all right what's up celesi what's up Alex hey thank you so much for having me on here um so I'll get right into my question so after doing full-time entrepreneurship for three years right um and you know raising a family I got four four small children all under the age of five I found myself in a very hard position where I had to go back to a ninet to-5 I'm actually at my nin to I'm I'm at my ninet to-5 right now sobody so now I'm like I'm like in a place that like you know like I would
(42:45) say entrepreneurship is like like you said it's hard and and I know what hard feels like but after discussing it with my wife like I felt like this was like the right decision after getting myself into business debt and other things like that and I didn't never have a paycheck to live on you know so how do I know when it's like like how do I get back into entrepreneurship like now I'm just running my stuff on the side so for example right when I was laid off uh three years ago I was doing taxes and I just doing like um bookkeeping and then
(43:20) I worked my way up starting to offer accounting services and then I leveled up and I started look going after higher leverage like now I started doing CFO services and um I went through that Valley of Despair thing and that's probably why I'm at where I'm at right now you know okay um just being completely honest and and now I'm like you're good no I said you're good man like don't worry like I I I I appreciate you being candidate upfront about it because otherwise this wouldn't be very valuable because You' tell me a bunch of fake information and I'll give you a response to fake information it wouldn't matter for either of us so
(43:57) thank you for being honest um that being said you're not honestly you're in a pretty good spot and I'll tell you why so you have a valuable skill set that will always be in demand because a lot of people don't want to do money stuff so people don't do budgets people don't do bookkeeping people don't do CFO work people do financials projections forecast no one wants to do any of that stuff and you do and you're good at it so presumably you're good at because you keep doing it right I'll just I'll leave
(44:20) it at that I'm gonna assume that for the sign for call right so um one I think it was wise that you got a job because you have a wife you have four kids I think that was a smart Noggin move okay now that being said there's going to be a conversation that you probably have to have with your wife about what because your nights and weekends either are going to have to go to family or they're going to have to go to the new thing and so I think that you need to have a candy conversation with her and say listen my Prim and I'm just I'm putting words in your mouth here so this
(44:53) is if I wear your shoes I would say as a man my primary drive is to provide and right now I feel like I'm failing you and I want to lead our children by example so that when they are 20 or 30 and they're thinking about making that jump I can speak to it because I wasn't afraid to take the risk again because in gymnastics as soon as you fall off the pommel horse even if you twist or break your ankle you know what they do they try and get you right back on the horse again and they do that because if you don't and you take enough time off you
(45:28) start developing these fears around getting back on you never get on again and so they want you to get back on the horse right now I think you got bucked by the entrepreneurial horse and that's okay it happens it's part of the game right like it's the it's the the scene in Rocky 17 or whatever Rocky it is where he's like it's not about how hard you can hit about but it's about hard you can get hit and keep going forward right and so you got hit big you know big whoop everybody gets hit everyone loses all the time I lost everything twice before this time right and so like you've lost everything
(45:58) once you still you still owe me one right you can tell your wife I said that and so let's get into tactics all right so right now the in my opinion the issue that you miss is you didn't know how to advertise you didn't know how to promote and so you have the service you just got to let people know about it and so you were full-time as an entrepreneur but you probably weren't spending four hours a day promoting and you're 100% correct right so that's that's what you need to do so nights and weekends for you is you log out of work go home kiss the dog
(46:28) high five the kids and then you spend four hours promoting and promoting is you make content you reach out to people or you run ads and given your financial situation it's going to be making content and reaching out to people that's it literally if that's what you're you start your timer four hours you make content you reach out to people and you do that for four straight hours every day you do that you're gonna have more business in the next six months you even know know to do it dang that's it that's all you have to do like you the thing is you're in a good spot because you have the skill
(46:58) that there's already demand like I don't have to test your idea you're trying to provide bookkeeping services it's a commoditized service like if you do a good job you're on time like you are responsive you deliver things on the first of the month people will want to do business with you and they'll stay with you and so you just got to let people know about it faster because I'm guessing that your rate was based on referrals you had one or two customers maybe three and by the time you get one new referral every two or three months one would drop and you stayed there
(47:22) until eventually you couldn't right I'm guessing that was the story right so you just need to increase your sales velocity which means you got to let more people know about it and you got to learn how to sell because it was just you right did you have employees no I had a virtual assistant during tax season but yeah it was mainly just me yeah then you have the easiest business in the world because 100% of the revenue is profit right it's just you for now and so you can absolutely get yourself to 10 20 accounting clients and you're gonna be working like a dog at this point but you'll be making way more than you are now and then you'll have new
(47:52) problems because then your wife's like I don't see you anymore you're like yeah but now we're making three times money and I will find a way to use the money to buy back some time and you can do that but idea like you're you're like you already have the hard done you're like six months away seriously like I don't normally say that like you're six months away you gota you got to reach out to let's call it let's call it 10,000 people okay you reach out to 10,000 people you'll have the you'll have the business you want got it even if you suck you'll have
(48:18) the business you want if reach out to 10,000 people and just ask them if they need help with that thing because I'm telling you right now as a business owner dude the amount of crappy accountants and bookkeepers that out there outnumber the good ones 100 to one like no one's stoked about their bookkeeper so like like it's not hard and like think about it those guys don't like those guys suffer the same issue that you have is they don't know how to promote themselves they're not business people they're Bean counters and so like
(48:43) you you've been you've been in bean counter mode and you got to get in you got to get in promoter mode especially as a as a solo entrepreneur it's all promotion in the beginning so would you suggest just mainly cold Outreach or should I try to do content or just go straight cold Outreach you can do both I mean dude one post a day one post a day see who interacts with it so who likes it who comments on it you can message all those people and then you can reach out as well but the thing is is with your profession finding someone who has an adjacent audience so
(49:12) uh you know if someone who's an HR company or recruiting company right like if you can figure out a way to just work with them they already have a whole engine of people coming in and just see if you can just get off the backside and give them a kickback just for intros like that's a super prod way of uh of leveraging the amount of reach outs like you can just reach out to 10,000 business owners and you'll you'll get your nut but you could probably reach out to a thousand B2B businesses and see if you can structure a partnership with them that they can refer you business and you refer it back to them either of those at work okay okay yes content and
(49:44) Outreach you and real talk the content is probably not in the beginning where you're going to get the majority of your business I just want to just prepare you for that but the reason that you're going to be making the content at the beginning is that so when you do Reach Out people will go to your page and they will consume your content and then they will decide to respond based on the quality so think about that stuff as lead nurture more than lead genen in the beginning over time you'll get better at
(50:06) it it'll start generating business but it might take you a year or two like it takes time to get good at that yeah hey thank you so much Alex I I just want to say thank you so much because like the past three years I just listen to the game podcast like all the time and that's honestly what's got me through everything but I it just it just honors me and it makes it makes me so happy like as a father and as as like a aspiring entrepreneur to to meet you and and everything that you do like you've inspired me and that's the reason why I took the jump in the beginning so I
(50:40) appreciate you well I appreciate you for taking the jump and um I will ask you to trust me one more time which is that four hours a day have the conversation with your wife 10,000 regs awesome she she's watching so she knows all right let celese take his 10,000 that's it like on the other side of 10,000 reach outs is you making the money that you want to make and having the skill of promotion and sales that's it awesome thank you so much 100 every day rule of 100 I got it thanks Alex you better brother life is hard believing it should be easy makes it
(51:22) harder oh man it was um Dr CEO Ghost Writer I feel so bad right now um but you you you had this issue which was that you said you wanted to have a thousand books to sell and you basically made an equation that was if I don't get X I will be unhappy and so um I think the first person I heard this was from nval but he said um desire is making a contract to be unhappy until you get what you want and so it's like signing a contract by saying life should be easy and every moment it isn't easy I will be unhappy like that makes it more difficult than
(52:03) just being willing to weather the harder times and so when I do get down on myself because I do too I actually had a pretty sad day I woke up this morning and I I actually messaged Leila I was like I'm really sad today I was like I don't know why I was like I'm just giving you a heads up um I try and think what expectation spoken or unspoken am I making of the universe that I feel is fulfilled and is that expectation reasonable and more often than not I can identify what the expectation is and once you pull it out and look at it you
(52:33) think about how ridiculous it is like I the expectation that I have of the universe is that I should be able to sell a thousand books because I deserve it and by the way deserving is the exact opposite of gratitude so I am I want to publicly State wholeheartedly that I am hardcore against anyone thinking they deserve anything so people are like get what you deserve ask what what you want BL but you don't deserve anything you can get things for what you do but you don't deserve them because if you do get
(53:03) things when you believe you deserve them then you will not be grateful for them you will expect them and then it takes something that otherwise would have been amazing and nullifies it it's like spitting on a gift and so I try to take this perspective of I deserve nothing and I'm grateful for everything and obviously that's very hard because life is about creating predictions and trying to meet those predictions but as much as I can be aware of the times where I feel more anxious or more sad or more angry or more upset or frustrated it usually comes down to what expectation my
(53:34) demanding from life that is unreasonable and realistically it's almost always just any expectation that I have of life that does not care and so um that perspective and I share that one because like entrepreneurship sucks a lot of the time like most of the day-to-day of Entrepreneurship is just getting kicked in the nuts every single day for years years on end with an occasional glimmer of hope followed by a swift kick in the nuts and so like one you have to have pain tolerance but that's that makes it sound super Alpha and whatever because I don't really
(54:08) think it's pain tolerance I think it's reframing pain as reality and something to be expected and the price that we are willing to pay for the thing that we want and so it's like the $500 Nikes it's like you can't be upset that the Nikes it's like going to the store and being upset that something costs a certain price and I know some people do that which is a great recipe for being upset all the time but like it's just a trade you can choose to not make the trade and that's the thing is like we have the choice it's voluntary like we chose to become entrepreneurs we chose
(54:38) to start businesses and with that choice comes consequences and one of those consequences is forever feeling uncertain and always dealing with pain and I saw this tweet by Elon Musk yesterday and I thought it was so perfect he basically said being an entrepreneur is always getting I'm paraphrasing what's left over it's after everyone's done their job and then there's the really terrible thing that no one wants to do guess who gets to do that you because it's no one else's business and it's also no one else's job and so like the definition of what you are as the founder or the entrepreneur of your
(55:13) business is that after all of the tasks have been done from the people who have their jobs being done the the the steaming pile of terrible conversations that you have to have have those are yours no one takes those for you and whenever there's an unknown circumstance like we've never seen this before gets who gets to do that you and guess who gets to mess it up and think about it for the next five years also you and you just accumulate these scars until eventually you see a second one that reminds you of one that happened three years ago and you're like o i remember
(55:44) what I did that time and that didn't work I will try something different and hopefully this time it sucks a little bit less and it's literally that cycle over and over again until the sucking just becomes normal because I don't think like I don't think entrepreneurship sucks less the higher up you go I think you just get so used to it that I mean I I'll tell you a story like I remember the first time I had legal concerns like an employee said that a wrongful termination or whatever right and I like you know I had all the anxiety what if they're going to end the business what's going to happen now but
(56:20) then I got the second one and my third one and my fifth one and at this point like Elon Musk is always engaged in a hundred ongoing lawsuits at all times if you have people will try to take it from you it is how it works and so if you if you have never had a legal concern it means you have never had anything worth taking and so it's not that you are failing it is a sign that you are on the right path like you don't have hardship if you're not moving forward like the only time that you truly have no hardship is if you're not growing like nothing says stagnation
(56:56) like a comfortable entrepreneur and so the fact that you're in pain means that you are growing which is why they call them Growing Pains like and that is voluntary because we chose to become better and part of that becoming better means breaking the old self that you had into a thousand pieces and feeling every single crack that has to happen and then watching the new fresh skin come underneath of it stronger and thicker than before all right well Instagram Twitter Youtube hope you guys enjoyed one of zero live this was our our first shot at this this was a uh an experiment we like to try
(57:41) new things here we're experimental if you will um and if you guys dug this or this was interesting for you guys uh please let us know and if this also blue let us know and if you if you were like you know what this part was great and this wasn't let us know like we take all feedback we accept all feedback now we might not do everything you say but we will absolutely accept all feedback and so um that's the biggest gift that you can give us if any of this was valuable for you the gift that I asked for is that you let us know how it was um
(58:10) otherwise I just want you to know and I and I hope that mation exists here for this one reason which is that like you are not alone there are other people going through it and so despite that it may feel lonely you were not alone keep being one of Zero by n

(00:00) so here's my promise to you guys today I can show you how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff and I want to be clear the lead getting strategies I share with you today work for Real Estate medical Auto homeowners insurance Health Care local businesses home services financial services consumer services software apps e-learning online businesses e-commerce and anything that sells stuff to anyone and I know they work because I use them in our portfolio companies today which include software local business
(00:32) e-commerce consumer services medical services Professional Services home services and more so I know this works from experience and not Theory which brings up one of my favorite quotes from LH Hardwick a man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an opinion so that being said let's begin 100 million dollar leads how to get strangers to want to buy your stuff so first things first for those of you who do know me I want to address the elephant in the room is Alex going to finally sell us something has anyone else been wondering this
(01:07) because it's been two years and the only thing I've made available for purchase is a Kindle book for a dollar and ninety nine cents so I can't tell you the answer to that yet you'll have to stay and find out but what I can tell you is at the end of the presentation we will be exporting the list of every single person here alive to give you the special project that I've been working on for four years and I can't tell you what it is yet you'll find out in a moment but what I can tell you is it's more than a gift card it's less than a Tesla and every
(01:40) single person here live today will get one for free and you will be the only people who get one and I did it this way so that next time I say be there it'll be worth it anyone not here will believe me because I give them proof that I keep my promises and to the same degree as we dive in I don't expect you to take my word for how good the opportunity I'm about to share with you is I want to prove it to you so let me explain so when I see stuff like this it bothers me right you see books this is how to
(02:10) Market a book and you can look and say you know there's 14 reviews on it so I don't need to read the book to know that the book doesn't contain contents that know how to Market a book because I have evidence in the real world that the concepts the book are not effective I don't need to read it I already know it isn't good and it's kind of like a dentist with bad teeth or somebody claiming they can help you grow your social media flying with less than 100 followers right you should walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk in fact
(02:35) I'd argue that the walk is the only talk that matters and so a lot of what I do is somewhat meta meaning I'm trying to both Show and Tell at the same time so for example my first book 100 million dollar offers answered the question what do I sell answer so good an offer is so good people feel stupid saying no it demonstrated the concept it outlined creating a grand slam offer it was high value it included a free course with no opt-in which today is over a million views which was high value with a low price relative to what it delivered
(03:14) and a high price to Value discrepancy 100 million offers is itself a grand slam offer using the value equation as its guiding star and two years later it's still number one in every category it's listed with over fifteen thousand five stars it helps unless you go from 50 45 000 a month to 170 000 a month it helps until you go from ten thousand a month to forty five thousand a month to help Scott 10x his business from 50 to 100 a month to 53 000 a month and Tanner get his first business started and get to five thousand a month from zero as a kid in his twenties and if you want the bigger numbers it
(03:51) helps Antoine go from 50 000 a month to 750 000 a month and the zillions of other real stories who use the stuff in 100 million dollar offers to start or grow their businesses so I can feel confident saying its success became its own proof its content works and so after releasing that book in July of 2021 I wanted to use the next 24 months leading up to this event as one thing proof proof that the stuff that I show in 100 million dollar leads actually works to get leads today in the real world and it'll work for you too because I wasn't born with a five
(04:29) million person audience this is only 24 months ago on YouTube and this is today and this was 24 months ago on my podcast a completely different platform and this is today and I did this spending only two days per month dedicated to advertising with the rest of my time running our portfolio in fact during this time within the first 24 months our portfolio companies on average 2.8 x revenue and 4.
(04:54) 7 next profit meaning you can still do the stuff that grows your company without spending all your time getting leads you just need to do it better and I wanted to use this event as my own evidence for the book I used all eight methods which I'll explain shortly to advertise the book I did it with the sole purpose to show that they work to advertise anything to any one period so I used all the methods in the book to advertise the book itself because if you know what you're doing you don't need a lot of time you just
(05:26) need to do the right stuff the right way but knowing what to do is the hardest part again which is why we've dedicated our huge resources to this mission to make real business education accessible for everyone and I'm going to do my darnest to live up to that idea for you guys today that is my promise so I'm going to deliver to two types of people today type one for people who need to put their oxygen mask on and take care of themselves and their family I promise you I will help you get closer to that today for free
(05:56) period so you're going to want to stay until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time and I'm saying until my absolute Last Breath believe me when I say it we're going to be on a on a twisty and Tourney Road today it'll be fun and for group two for those of you who are in a position to help me pay it forward I'm going to show you how it's in your self-interest to help me help everyone else and if you decide to join me I'll show you how we can accomplish both our missions together because at the end of the day no one's going to save you life is not a bedtime
(06:25) story The Cavalry isn't coming you're it so you've got to learn this stuff period so now that we got that out of the way let's get some leads so let's Zoom all the way out who here would like to start or grow their business bigger than it currently is let me know in the chat great otherwise this would have been a very short presentation so rather than talk about all the ways that we could grow it I want to take the reverse approach how could you guarantee that you'd shrink or never grow to begin with answer tell no one about your stuff
(07:08) and if no one knows about your stuff we can be pretty sure they aren't going to buy it we laugh but some of you are doing this right now so let's assume that you already have something to sell amazing valuable thing if more people find out about it do you make more money yes so here's a writer Downer all else being equal when you double your leads you double your business sometimes it really is that simple there's a reason these companies hit billions almost overnight they had already advertised enough to
(07:42) build that size company they just needed to make an offer and that's great for them but what if you're in the reverse situation you have an offer and no one to give it to then you need to let them know about your stuff in other words you need to advertise bottom line advertising is important because if no one knows about your stuff no one buys it but there's another huge reason getting leads is so important for entrepreneurs if you always know how to get more leads it gives you endless chances to get it right and as much as I could keep hitting this point I figured I might as well give you
(08:20) a sneak peek of what's inside the book so I'm going to read the first page to you is that all right you guys mind on that all right you have to sell stuff to make money it seems simple enough but everyone tries to skip to the make money part it doesn't work I tried you need all the pieces you need the stuff to sell and offer you need people to sell it to leads then you got to get all those people to buy it sales once you put all those in place then you can make money my first book 100 million dollar offers covers the first step and gives you the stuff it answers the age-old question
(08:57) what should I sell answer and offer so good people feel stupid saying no but strangers can only buy your stuff if they know you exist this takes leads leads mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people but most agree that they're the first step to getting more customers in simpler terms it means they've got the problem to solve and the money to spend if you're reading this book you already know that leads don't magically appear you need to go get them more precisely you need to need to help them need to help them find you so they
(09:26) can buy your stuff and the best part is you don't have to wait you can force them to find you you do that through advertising advertising the process of making known lets strangers know about the stuff you sell if more people know about the stuff you sell then you sell more stuff if you sell more stuff then you make more money having lots of leads makes it hard to be poor advertising lets you have a terrible product and still make money it lets you be terrible at sales and still make money it lets you make a ton of mistakes and still make money
(09:56) in short having this skill gives you endless chances to get it right and in the unforgiving world of business Second Chances are hard to come by so you might as well load up advertising is a skill worth having and this book 100 million dollar leads shows you exactly how to do it so here's what I'm going to do in our short time together number one share a few breakthrough experiences I had when learning how to advertise to save my businesses you will get my lesson without my scar two give you guys a bunch of money
(10:26) making stuff this one I can promise you will trust me three invite you to join me on my mission of making real business education accessible for everyone and four get out of your way so you can tear off the wrapping paper and dig into my last four years of work cool great so here's a visual of our journey together let's start with the first way that you get leads warm Outreach so here's how I learned it so here I am a defense contractor top secret clearance I'm 21 years old I'm not happy my work I wanted to start a
(11:01) business but I was too chicken maybe some of you guys are in this boat so I'd have started decided to start a fitness non-profit because I liked Fitness but I was still afraid to charge money and if I failed at a non-profit and still had my job it wouldn't hurt my status right safe bet but I wanted people who participated to have some skin in the game so they'd still care and try I called it the free training project this is my actual outside I was able to find it so the premise was simple people would
(11:30) donate 500 to a thousand dollars to the charity of their choice and I would train them online for no compensation and I'd give them nutrition workouts a weekly weekly eating out guide and answer questions in between and that idea was all great except I had no customers so I reached out to every one of my friends list 101 and I asked if they knew anyone who'd be interested I was like hey do you know anybody who's looking to get in shape and out of thousands of them six six said yes so they donated I trained them and months later they got results
(12:04) I still have the first six to this day eventually I wanted to make this a real business but they were paying a charity and not me so I asked them to start paying me directly I was the charity now and a few did and that's how I advertised to start my first business using warm Outreach AKA reaching out to people who know you one on one and learning to advertise this way saved me from a career I didn't enjoy and got me started on my entrepreneurial Journey you can look at the difference in my facial expression between these two pictures these are only a few months apart you can see how much this meant to
(12:40) me so that's how I learned worm Outreach here's how I used it for this book the cool part about where mountain is no matter how advanced you get you still use it for example I reached out to some of my buddies privately and asked them to come to my book launch event and they're here with us now and whether you're getting your first five customers your next five customers or you're launching a new product in a division of a company it often starts the same way with warm Outreach and the best part is you can start using it the moment you get off this presentation
(13:10) today so that's how I learned it here's how I used it for this book oh sorry here's how you use for the book here's where you can use it today so warm Outreach works on email phone call direct messages physical mail voicemails carrier pigeons anything where you talk to people one-on-one all right on platforms like these so that's where you can use it today now let's talk about the second way to get leads posting free content so here's how I learned it now after I had some customers I wanted more but I didn't know how because I had already messaged my entire contact list
(13:45) so I made a post so here was my first ever public advertisement you can see it April 9 2013 Baltimore Maryland which is where I'm from everyone for those of you who know me you know two things one I am terrible with all things technological for example I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago seriously two I love training nutrition and fitness more than well a whole lot so today is sort of special because it marks a day where my love of training vanquished see me being fancy here vanquished my fear of Technology what do I mean for the better part of a
(14:16) year I've been taking part in a free personal training project with the idea that I would give away free personal training to anyone who is willing to give some of their 500 to a thousand dollars to a cause of their choice this way they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me but be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves when I first introduced the idea I was happily surprised with the amount of positive support I received so almost a year for my first client I now have a website to
(14:37) formally show you some of the Transformations that have gone underway using my programming and as a formal means of contacting me about signing up I currently have a few slots open my roster so drop me a quick note if you're interested thanks so much take a quick second to check out the ridiculous transformations and unlike before I now had some proof I could advertise so I started making posts about what I was doing with my clients with some Fitness content in between so on the left you can see some of the fitness
(15:02) content and on the right you can see some of the testimonials and from that content in those testimonials over the next month I messaged anyone who interacted with any post I had and asked them if they wanted help and that gave birth to the body forward skinny to soil project you can see the date there and I signed up 20 guys at 200 bucks a month which equated at four thousand dollars a month learning how to advertise through making content allowed me to eat in the early days between my job and before I started my first gym learning to get leads through posting
(15:30) saved me from a life I didn't want it gave me the resources that I needed to learn more now what I didn't know is that I had unknowingly stumbled on the second way you can advertise posting content AKA you post content to people who know you one to many so that's how I learned it here's how I use it for this book so we recorded content months prior to the launch and planned it out and this was our actual calendar so you can see I had 17 shorts filmed I had six long forms filmed we had 143 total posts 20 sorry 143 total lead post 2200 total
(16:07) posts and that was across Instagram LinkedIn Twitter Tick Tock YouTube shorts and threads all right and I want to pause here because I think it's an important lesson that it took me too long to figure out which is that if you do have an audience or you do start posting content if you do want to start promoting something you don't want to just stop posting the stuff that your entire audience is there for and then only start talking about your thing you keep talking about your thing as much as you were before and
(16:31) then start your promotions on top of that which means you actually need to do even more during that period of time if you want to promote something and I think this is one of the big mistakes that a lot of people make when they are trying to promote something to an audience and so combining the leads post with the content post this is over 300 pieces per week and here are the resulting Impressions from those posts over 400 million impressions and we use the same content framework in every post to maximize the likelihood that we hook retain and reward people
(17:01) for clicking consuming and coming back that is the hook retain reward framework you'll see it again and that resulted in 194 000 registrations so almost half of you guys here today and here's the craziest thing if you were to pay for those cpms at 20 bucks each that's three million dollars a month in free advertising that's how powerful this is so that's how I used it for this book here's how you can use it today so the fact that I got my first customers from organic content then and built the following that we have now is why I can tell you that it worked then
(17:42) and it works now and although the platforms may change the principles remain the same and like anything you can scale this from one post a week to 250 posts a week so you can do this in tiny amounts or huge amounts it works the same and here are some examples of platforms available to do this on today you got YouTube Shorts YouTube Longs podcasts SiriusXM Radio LinkedIn tick tock Instagram stories Instagram reels Instagram posts Twitter and more so let's talk about the third way to get leads running paid ads so here's how I learned it
(18:21) now back to our story once I had clients from posting content I wanted more noticing a recurring theme Here so I started shadowing at a gym the gym owner Sam didn't use any paid advertising he used a method called Groupon to get new customers some of you younger Lads might not remember this but some of the older folks in the room will after watching how it worked I was convinced I could do the same thing and launch my own gym so right before I left this gym to start my own I remember calling a mentor I
(18:49) said okay so here's how it works you get a hundred people who buy your Groupon every month for 39 bucks and from there you get 40 of them to stay for 150 bucks a month so you get paid to get new customers and every month you add another 6 000 per month in recurring Revenue he was like I'm not sure it's going to be that easy but you have my blessing so I went out signed my first lease and started my Groupon but nothing happened crickets so here I am freaking out that I just signed my life away with no way to get leads and here's the part of the story
(19:23) that many of my audience don't know so I was actually supposed to have a partner at my first location and two weeks before our location was supposed to open he said hey we should go to this marketing seminar cost three grand they guarantee that if you don't make 10 grand by the end of the weekend they'll give your money back and despite being quite broke I obviously said I could use 10 grand let's go and so over those two days I didn't make 10 grand but I did learn about this thing called Facebook ads
(19:47) then when I got back from that Workshop something unexpected happened we broke up my partner backed out of the partnership so I had to use the rest of my savings to pay his half to open the gym so here I am sleeping on the floor with no clients I owe rent in weeks I have one month saved up so I put up the ugliest ad you've ever seen just like I'd learned at the workshop I'm looking for five local residents to take place in a free six-week challenge you must let us use your performing after pictures in our Marketing in exchange for the program click the link to sign
(20:17) up no images no videos no frills just words all caps and it worked I signed up 29 members before I opened in the city I knew no one I actually ended up sending this picture to my father to show them that I was doing something good and funny enough the cash I collected from them was exactly enough to pay my rent I still remember the business account going to zero at the end of the month woof but the next month I spent more money on ads and got more customers and then more and learning how to run ads allowed me
(20:50) to start my gym in Huntington Beach on my own without a partner without savings without knowing anyone and if I had not learned how to run paid ads on a random weekend I would not be standing in front of you today truly if I hadn't learned how to get leads my gym would have gone under in less than a month because I only had a month saved up and I would have had to go back to this job as a failure and that would have sucked simply put learning to run paid ads gave me the ability to survive long enough to
(21:20) figure out what I was doing and just like that I had learned the third way that you can let other people know about your stuff paid ads AKA letting strangers know one to many so that's how I learned them here's how I used it for this book so for this book launch we ran paid ads on these platforms YouTube Shorts YouTube songs Facebook Instagram reels Instagram stories Instagram posts and tick tock and I followed the exact steps in this book so that you could all go back and look at them as examples to model I wrote These simple ads
(21:56) using this simple three-step framework from the book The what who when framework I go into very deep description of every aspect of how you can script A Nat and how you get endless variations with one framework and then these ads got these results we spent 275 000 we got 137 000 of you here and our cost per lead is about two bucks and I pushed them to this simple landing page which I got directly from the book this is layout number two and it had a 55 opt-in rate for those who know what that is are you guys seeing how we use the stuff in the book to advertise the book itself you guys getting that getting some hands
(22:35) on the screens you guys getting that all right AKA proof that this stuff works so that's how I use it for this book here's how you can use it today you can use it on all these platforms Hulu radio LinkedIn Tick Tock Spotify Instagram Twitter podcast and more and the best part is if you know what you're doing you can immediately start using paid ads to get leads for your business today they're the fastest way to get more leads especially if you're like I was with no one knowing you like I was in Hudson Beach when I started right and they work even if you have no following and you can start with as little as a
(23:10) few dollars a day and you can scale them as much as you want for example today across our portfolio we spend more than a million dollars per week in ads and a lot of people try and make it sound complicated they're not they only make them sound complicated because they understand them well enough yet to explain them simply I must say that again people only make ads sound complicated because they don't understand them well enough to make them simple because once you do understand them they're easier than you think so that's
(23:41) pretty much what I did for a while I kept posting content I kept reaching out to folks and running paid ads and that's how I scaled my gyms and was able to eventually sell my locations and that's when I started my next company gym launch our licensing business when everything went really right for context over the next four years we took out 40 million dollars in owner distributions and then something terrible happened and it went really wrong really fast and so I was forced to get a new way to get leads which brings us to the fourth way to get leads cold Outreach
(24:18) so here's how I learned it so whoosh it's 20 20. and I uh hit puberty again and now I've scaled and sold my gyms I'm now scaling gym launcher gym licensing company using all the methods that I've discussed so far but all of a sudden covet hits and 100 of my customers aren't allowed to do business so here's what happened month one fifteen percent of gyms permanently close by month six another 15 percent of gyms permanently close meaning 30 percent of all gyms are forever out of business with the rest seriously struggling my clients are scared my employees are scared my ads are failing and somehow I
(25:00) have to figure out a way to get more customers and I'm not really sure what to do so one morning I wake up early and check my Instagram and I see a new message it says hey Alex kill told me you guys don't need salesman anymore so my offer got pulled I quit my job to accept it I'm super honored as you consider me I hope you consider me again next time you have openings I scrolled up in the conversation I was the one who had told him to apply I felt horrible so I messaged him I was like you on and he was so he hopped on a call
(25:27) here's how the conversation went so he said he worked at a gym software company doing 10 million a month I was like holy cannoli I was like okay well uh how do you guys get clients he's like oh we're 100 outbound I was like huh so then I asked him what was that offer that kale pulled he's like oh it's going to be a closer I was like huh well you think you could do that outbound stuff here he's like yeah I could do it I'm confident I can make it profitable in 90 days so I said deal I'll front you the time of the money to spin this up and so I hired him and we
(25:58) built an outbound machine together and so here's what happened over the next few months September the first month zero sales zippola nothing October two sales December for sales January six sales February 10 sales March 14 sales April 20 sales May 30 sales and 480 000 in monthly Revenue cold Outreach save gym launch during its hardest time during covid and it was pivotal in making it a sellable company that didn't rely on my face and keep growing to this day the company is up 45 from what I sold without bound equating to over 50 of sales
(26:39) learning to advertise with cold outbound kept my company alive and that's how I learned cold Outreach which is simply privately letting people know who don't know you about your stuff AKA advertising one to one to strangers so that's how I learned it here's how I used it for this book so I reached out to people to ask to be on their podcast to speak about the book I was like are you going to build your podcast they're like you sure can and this is actually a more advanced move combining two types of advertising which I'll get to later but if you see a boatload of podcasts come out after the book is out that's
(27:13) where many of them came from so that's how I use it for the book here's how you can use it today you can knock on 100 Doors you can send 100 DMS you can make 100 calls you can leave 100 voicemails all you got to do is get away to contact them figure out what to say contact them until they're ready and able to listen that's it and you can do it on all these platforms SMS DMS emails LinkedIn messenger Instagram messenger Twitter messenger voicemail physical mail and of course carrier pigeons and you can start with a tiny budget all you need is time a way to contact people and knowing what to say when they reply
(27:49) that's all you need and you can scale all the way up using other people's time and automation and the best part is you get to pick who you reach out to you pick your own leads so you can make sure that you only reach out to the most qualified Perfect Fit highest value targets for example if you only want to reach out to hedge fund managers over a billion dollars in assets under management you can do that for context within our portfolio we do a total of 15 000 plus reach outs per day and generate zillions that's the actual number zillions of engaged leads per day as a result
(28:28) as a fun proof Point Jim launch has spoken to not reached out to spoken to 25 000 gym owners so I'm being clear they've gotten on the phone with 25 000 gym owners in an industry of only 150 000 gyms in health clubs all right that's one out of six of all gyms and that's how you can know this stuff works so now you know the four methods of advertising which I call the core four they're the only four ways you can let other people know about your stuff core four number one warm Outreach core for number two posting free content cool for number three running paid ads call
(29:05) for number four cold Outreach but the natural question is are there other ways to advertise and the answer is yes and no you on your own cannot advertise in other ways but other people can for you and I called those people the four lead getters you've got customers employees agencies and Affiliates and Lead Getters using the core4 complete the advertising cycle for example let's say you post free content to tell people about your stuff and get customers who then tell other people about your stuff using warm Outreach and you get more customers
(29:49) or let's say you run paid ads to tell people about your stuff and get Affiliates who then tell other people about your stuff by posting free content to their audiences and you get more customers and so the most efficient way to advertise is to let other people do it on your behalf because only two people can let strangers know about the stuff you sell you and other people and there are more of them than there are of you and I can explain the insane power of lead Getters with one simple comparison on one hand you can do the core four all
(30:24) day every day to get leads your work is high your leads are low your Leverage is lowest on the other hand you can get one person to get an army of lead getters to do the core four for you so your work is now low your leads are high and your Leverage is highest in other words in the second scenario you work way less but you get four times the leads and that's the insane power of lead Getters and once you know how to harness them you can get as many leads as you darn well please without spending your time on it it's how our portfolio generates twenty thousand plus leads per day without me doing any advertising for
(31:08) them to get leads to be clear I advertise to get portfolio companies but I don't advertise for my portfolio companies to get customers and that's leverage the difference between what you put in and what you get out and that's how you build a 100 million dollar leads machine the same one that got five hundred thousand plus of you amazing individuals here today and I don't have time to get to explain the other four lead Getters in detail but let me at least give you the gist you don't do lead Getters you do the core four to get them and then they do the core four on your behalf
(31:44) so let me give you a couple examples so first and simplest you have customers who then get you other customers it's how my last book sold 467 000 copies with zero dollars in paid ads so real quick who you heard about this event from someone else or because you read the last book drop a thumb in the chat give me some thumbs who here came for that came because of that reason Bernie did Nicholas did Javier did William did Charles did Nicholas another Nicholas Suzanne all right great this referral stuff works
(32:21) then you've got employees who do the core four on your behalf which is how Mosey media our team made the 143 book posts of content and 2200 plus pieces in the last six weeks so real quick how many of you guys saw content about this event drop a thumb in the chat who here came from content rather than because you read the last book or someone told you to great Tyron Jacob this team stuff works then you've got agencies who post content run ads or do Outreach on your behalf that's who actually click the button since we don't actually run ads for our
(32:59) holding company we're a holding company we don't actually transact and so we had an agency run the ads on our behalf so real quick who here heard about this event from Paid ads that you saw paid ads is that what made you click and come in Click a thumb or drop a thumb in the chat Santiago Marguerite Jawad all right Vaughn there we go great that's how you can know that this stuff works today so then you've got Affiliates who do the core forward of Their audience on your behalf which is how we had 23 722 Affiliates post content run ads and email their lists about this event
(33:40) real quick who here heard about this event from another business drop a thumb in the chat Greg arika Raphael Lauren Robbie Mona so for the many of you who are here because someone else referred you from another business thank you over a hundred and four thousand three hundred and sixty one of you are here from affiliates and that's how you know this affiliate stuff works and the result of using the core four and the four lead Getters is proof everyone here today and that's how you know this stuff works and it'll work for you okay so far in this presentation we covered you make more money when more
(34:23) people find out about your stuff when you double your leads you double your business there are only two types of people who can get you leads you and other people we talked about the core four why these companies hit billions overnight AKA advertising we talked about warm reach outs we talked about posting content we talked about the hook retain reward framework we talked about how I use paid ads for this book we talked about the best landing page templates we talked about how I learned cold Outreach we talked about how to get
(34:50) leverage with lead Getters talk to how I use customer referrals to get even more leads and how we used our team to get even more leads and how we used advertising agencies to get even more leads and how we used Affiliates to get even more leads and that's how you know this stuff works and it'll work for you after all warm Outreach work to get my first customers posting content work to make enough for me to quit my job paid ads work to keep my gym from failing before even began and even eventually grew
(35:22) cold Outreach worked to save gym launch during covid and made it a sellable business referrals work to explode 100 million dollar offers employees work to make the content to remote this event agency work to run the ads for this event and 23 722 Affiliates work to advertise this book event to get a hundred and four thousand three hundred and sixty one of you here can you see how knowing how to get leads can give you the freedom to pursue the business or life you want can you see how learning to use these eight advertising methods can 2x 5x 100x
(35:54) your business can you see how learning how to get leads on demand gives you endless chances to figure it out in short can you see why advertising AK knowing how to get leads is a skill worth having and this skill may just be the bridge between where you are and wherever you want to go it has been for me great so here's what I know even if we had a full day together instead of just 90 minutes it's gonna be hard almost impossible for me to give you all that I could give you no matter how good anyone is one 90 minute presentation isn't going to change your life you need more than that and while everything I've given you
(36:28) today is valuable it's just the tip of the iceberg and if you like what I've shared with you so far you'll love what I have for you next you see before today I was faced with one of two choices the first option was to part ways with you and then just hope that you on your own would figure it out my second option was I could take a more active role in responsibility for your success and create a win-win situation I chose the second option the result of working six hours a day for two years everything I know about generating 100 million plus a year in sales
(36:58) everything I know about getting leads from a decade of advertising and so it's with great pleasure to introduce you to the 100 million dollar lead system with this system you will wield all eight methods as a master of advertising getting leads on command at prices your competition would drool over so here's what you guys are gonna get this is about to get bananas so just buckle up that's my warning that's my disclaimer before we rock and roll here if you're someone who doesn't get enough replies or opt-ins or your web pages don't convert or people don't trust you
(37:33) enough to buy or your religious play don't cost too much then pay attention this is for you lead magnet mastery all right now you might be wondering what's a lead magnet a lead man is a complete solution to a narrow problem it's the free thing giveaway before you're paid things you can get more people to buy here's how it'll make you money let's say you sell widgets all right if you go up to 100 people on the street and say hey buy my widget maybe one of them will buy everyone else will say pound sand I don't know who you are I don't trust you now let's introduce a lead magnet before
(38:02) your core offer so you go up to the same hundred people and say hey can I give you some value for free can I solve this problem for you for free a greater percentage of those people say yeah you can solve that problem for me and now with that bigger pool of people that you have now gained trust and solve the problem for you say hey I solved that first problem but now you've got the second problem let me solve that for you in exchange for money and then more than one of those people will say yes making a lead magnet the right way can
(38:26) 2x 5x sometimes 10x the leads that you have while adding value to the marketplace this is a big part I think people miss about lead magnets is that of course when you have the right lead magnet you make way more sales but what people Miss is that you actually also provide Goodwill to the marketplace because 99 of people are never going to buy from you and that's okay that's how it works but they are the ones who will build your reputation and so if you provide free value to the marketplace you build your reputation while also making more sales and that's
(38:52) the secret power of lead magnets now to show how powerful this is I personally took on a group of 10 businesses on my software Allen to implement the lead magnet system they were in Chiropractic online fitness Dental Physical Therapy in-home services in real estate and even flow tanks and here are their actual numbers from implementing the system all right so you can see one through ten you can see at the bottom we had some stragglers with some people who didn't do very much and you can see at the top we had some people who did a lot
(39:25) each company who fully adopted the new lead man exploded in revenue and growth in fact in the first 90 days each business went through went from zero to six thousand a month in additional Revenue to month two 19 000 a month in additional Revenue to month three thirty four thousand dollars a month in additional Revenue so the average business went up by month three to thirty four thousand nine hundred seventy two dollars on average and that included the folks that did nothing so you could say this worked
(39:56) and so here's what lead magnet Masters show you how to do step one figure out the best problem to solve all right this is probably one of the biggest mistakes people make when they're when they're picking lead matches actually solving the wrong problem there are problems you solve that get people to buy and they're problem solved that waste your time you got to pick the right ones second figure out how to solve it third figure out how to deliver it fourth test what to name it because if they don't like what you name
(40:18) it they're never going to consume it to begin with which brings it to number five which is make it easy to consume because they don't consume it they're not going to get value if they don't give value they're not going to buy step six make it darn good there's a specific way that I approach lead Max that make them better and make their increase their perception of value that can dramatically change the buy rates afterwards and finally step seven make it easy for them to tell you they want more this sounds crazy but step seven is actually the number one thing that people miss when they are making lead magnets and why they give a lead magnet
(40:46) away and then no one buys in fact this system alone permanently 17 extra applications at acquisition.com in three months so this is 2022 so I already still had a lot of traffic we had a relatively big audience even last year and this was when you introduced a new lead man using this and I was already doing Millions a month before discovering this new way that 17x my Elites all right so for you do you think you can at least double your lead flow overnight probably for me the system cost me twenty three thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars in development and three months of tests to figure out the hard slow and expensive way
(41:18) but I want to save you the three months of trial and error and the twenty three thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars it took me to learn this and just give you the fast Jeep and easy way is that cool this is so valuable you can literally do nothing else I show you just use lead magnet Mastery and double your leads tomorrow which I value today at only a fraction of my investment of time money at 997 dollars so that's the first thing you're going to get now oh I've got more if you haven't started your business yet or you want to start a side hustle or you're about to launch a new project or
(41:50) you have less than 20 customers then pay attention I made this for you the first five clients framework here's how it'll make you money let's say you want to get leads for a new thing on a zero dollar budget you're going to want a way to advertise that's reliable low risk repeatable and low cost and warm Outreach is a single advertising method that best meets these requirements so if you need to get customers this is the fastest cheapest and most certain way to get them and using room Outreach the right way
(42:21) we'll get you the first five customers that you need to start the business quit the job or launch the new product in fact Alexis used the principles from first five clients from to start her first online business and got her first three customers in her first month and then got three more customers the next month and then got three more customers the next month and then she used some of the more advanced stuff that I'm going to show you in a second and went from three customers per month to three customers a week and the best part is the first five clients from X Works no matter what you sell
(42:52) so here's what I'll show you how to do step one get your list step two pick the right platform step three personalize your message step four reach out so I'll give you the exact scripts the exact openers the things that we do the ACA framework that we've used to massage customers and Prospects to get them to want to buy step six get them to invite their friends step seven how to make the easiest offer in the world this is the one that everyone wants to say yes to and especially if you're starting out I'll just give it to you that way people say
(43:23) yes to you on the first shot step eight how to get the most from your leads which is there's three ways you can monetize leads I'll show you all three nine how how much and when to start charging especially when you're starting out getting the right price and knowing when to start charging someone and how much is one of the most confusing parts I'll show you step-by-step process that works every time in Step 10 I'll show you how to keep your list warm so it keeps bringing you leads month after month after month
(43:49) this is step by step the exact system that I used to get my first clients for free all right this system cost me two years of working a job I didn't love and two years of lost income to figure out the not fun way so that's a picture of me 10 years ago but I want to save you the two years it took me to figure it out and just give you the shortcut aka the fun way you can so you can start tomorrow and for many of you here today this is the only thing you need to quit your job and start that business that you have been thinking about and even though quitting your job and
(44:19) pursuing your dream is priceless to make sure you can actually get started I value the first five clients from I can only fraction of my investment time money at 297 dollars so here's what you get you get a lead magnet Mastery so you can get way more leads than you currently are you can get the first five clients Frameworks you can get your first five clients for free total value 12.94 .
(44:42) now I want to talk to somebody else in the audience if you're someone who wants to build a personal brand or you want to add boatloads of free media to your business or build a warm audience then I made this for you the MOSI media content method for the first time ever we're opening up the kimono of what we actually did to build this brand and so here's how posting content the right way makes you money one it will grow your audience as a natural consequence when you grow your audience you get more buyers and here's the third one that people don't expect is that when you do this all other lead
(45:12) methods benefit so let me explain so let's say you use warm Outreach or paid ads to get customers well if someone clicks on an ad a lot of us don't actually immediately buy you click on an ad and then you click the profile you consume some content you see if someone's legit and then you go back and buy and so if you have content there done the right way you'll actually lift all other lead generation methods you'll get way more leads for less money and this is in addition to the people that actually come in from the content itself for many of you can cut your lead cost
(45:43) in half while also growing your sales and so here's what the most immediate content method will show you how to do number one hook attention get them to notice your content so I'll show you how we pick great topics there's five buckets that I use every time that are completely unique to the individual so you never have to look like another Mickey Mouse copy paste person ever again B we did a we looked at a 50-year meta-analysis of news headlines the most viral news headlines that got shared the most and rather than give you a formula
(46:14) there are seven Timeless themes that humans respond to and I'll show you how to put those themes into your headlines without having to follow some you know cookie cutter format which brings me to C how to structure the content to get shared sometimes you have the same content formatted differently and then boom it gets a hundred times the views are reach but once they notice your content you got to get them to consume it so you have to retain the attention so I'll show you how to use lists steps and stories to keep people watching and then finally reward attention which
(46:47) is satisfy the reason they consumed it to begin with all right how do you keep promises elegantly and this is the important part at the right times a lot of people keep promises too early or don't do it at all or keep the wrong promise and if you do it the right way you get a massive lift in the amount of people who share it this is the exact system that I used to get from here to here and get almost half of everyone here today and it took me two years to figure it out and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month in payroll but I'm not going to ask you for two years of your life and
(47:17) 3.6 million dollars I'm just going to hand you the keys this is literally what Built My Brand my most valuable asset in 24 months and it can help you build one too which I value today at a thousandth of my investment in time and money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so here's what you get number one is I'll show you how to cut your lead cost in half using lead magnet Mastery number two you're gonna get your first five clients so you can pick whatever platform you want to get customers on you're going to get the most immediate content method so you can build the brand that you want to have authority in whatever space you're in
(47:47) total value 3291 now let's say you're in the opposite situation you never want to be the face you hate being on camera or making content or you hate the constantly changing platform algorithms but you still want to make consistent sales that I made this for you the cold Outreach Playbook so here's what code Outreach is also number one you don't need to be good on camera number two you don't need to make tons of content number three your competition will never know what you're doing so you can operate in secrecy I
(48:15) told you earlier there's a 10 million a month business in Myspace I don't even know they existed because they used outbound four if you do enough volume it becomes incredibly reliable in short once you have it going you become very hard to stop I already told you this Playbook has been worth millions to me getting this advertising method going can 5x the value of your business and now I use it across our portfolio to instantly and reliably grow their sales and value and at the very least once you implement
(48:41) it you can sleep well at night knowing you'll always have leads in fact Miguel used the principles from cold Outreach playbook for his local business he needed to get new customers so you add it in outbound and within 90 days he had his first hundred thousand dollar a month all right check out his Revenue growth from cold Outreach so month one he was just doing his normal business and then boom he added in the color Outreach Playbook and doubled his business and then the next month he maintained his Revenue thereafter
(49:05) and you can see his comment there and so here's what cold hours play we'll show you how to do step one get a way to contact them get your leads so I'll show you how to buy lists how to scrape lists using software and how to manually assemble this if you're dead broke step two I'll show you how to know what to say all right so the exact voicemail scripts that we use the exact email scripts that we use the exact follow-up scripts that we use the exact DM scripts that we use and the warm-up Scripts so how to personalize the messages at scale to get replies and what to say
(49:38) when they reply and how to convince strangers to take the next step and then finally step three contact them when they're ready and able to listen so I'll show you how we automate delivery and automate distribution so that you can get way more replies for Less effort and the perfect follow-up sequence I told you 15 000 reach outs a day we know what the Cadence is I'll tell you it works best in fact this is the exact step-by-step process that we scaled during covid as a gym company so think about how ridiculous this is that was the sales growth we had during
(50:09) covid as a gym company that's how reliable this is once you get it going and it was the largest contributor to our 46.2 million dollar exit during covid so if it was the missing link for us then it can certainly work for you now no matter what your economic condition is around you and for me the system cost me 150 000 in payroll in six months of tests to figure out the painful way but I want to save you the six months of trial and error and the 150 000 it took me to learn this and just give you the winning lottery numbers you just got to cash them in
(50:38) you could literally ignore everything else I taught you today and use this to figure out the one message you need to send to make money and never worry about where you get your next sale from again that's it which would be life-changing for you but I value it today at a fraction of my investment time money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so you're gonna lead magnet Mastery so you can make banging lead magnets that people want to buy from you after you can get the first five clients Frameworks so that you can get your
(51:02) first five clients for free even if you have no dollars right now the most media content method that will help you build a brand that other people want to pay you money to get in front of your audience for that you can either choose not to or you can sell them stuff on your own the cold Outreach playbook for people who don't want to be on camera but still make money total value 52.
(51:26) 88 now let's say you're the type person who wants to get leads fast Ricky Bobby style and have a higher risk tolerance and when I'm on a smaller team as you scale then you're going to love this the paid ads Playbook here's why they're awesome they're the closest thing to legally printing money they always work it's just a matter of how well you don't need to spend more time to get more reach you just crank the spend you don't need an audience or a reputation you can test this with tiny budgets and you can scale them with the fused Revenue fewest humans per dollar Revenue and they're way way simpler than people make them out to be and despite my organic reputation I made my fortune
(52:02) running ads so believe me when I understand when I say that I understand where you're at if you don't have the life you want this is my bank account on December 20th of 2016. this is not that long ago and then I cracked paid ads and 24 months later this was my income after I expensed everything I can imagine cracking paid ads can be among the fastest changes in wealth you ever experience if you get it right it can 100x your business for me at 20 000 X to my bank account is probably because it was so low
(52:38) so I feel qualified to speak on the top and give you the secrets that most people don't teach so here's what paid ads Playbook will show you how to do number one know where to advertise 99 of the time people are just starting the wrong place number two get the Right audience to see it I can promise you if you get the right person to see your ads your ads don't even have to be that good number three make the best ad for them to see and the nice thing is that humans have not changed so you can follow the
(53:02) exact same process over and over again step four get permission to contact them because at the end of the day if they don't give you permission there's nothing you can do from there and this is the exact system I use to script every ad you saw over the past six weeks which I followed to a t to demonstrate that it works here are the actual results from only one platform so you can see here it's about two bucks a lead just to give you some context people who run events like this generally pay between 10 and 50 dollars per lead this is way less
(53:32) and across all platforms paid ads brought in 137 000 of you today and in case you're curious these ads converted the same prices to cold audiences so with this you'll be able to get way more better cheaper leads faster more reliably period so here's the deal it took me half a decade to learn how to do this and another half a decade to perfect the system and that was hard but I want to save you the losing everything twice stage in the five years of sucking for those of you know my story and just give the cheat codes to
(54:01) get it right the first time you can skip every other Playbook and get one profitable paid ads campaign printing money and cover the investment for this entire system for the rest of your life all right which could create generational wealth for you but I value today at only fraction my investment at 1 997 so you can get lead magnet Mastery so you can immediately get more leads from whatever platforms you're on you get the first five client framework you're gonna get the most immediate content method everything that we do opening up the kimono to show you how to
(54:25) scale your business the cold Outreach Playbook so that you can get leads bulletproof as long as you have a phone as long as you have an internet connection you can get customers the paid ads Playbook which scales faster than any other way to get customers total value 72.
(54:44) 85 now let's say you're the type of person who loves building great products or wants to build somebody that lasts generations and love taking care of customers and prefer to go with the highest profit margins possible then I get it which is why I made this for you the referral Playbook so what's a referral you might ask a referral happens when somebody a referrer sends an Engaged lead to your business anyone can refer but the best referrals come from your customers so here's how it'll make you money referrals are both worse worth more and cost less which is a dangerous combo for making money as a business and here's why this matters imagine you have a four to one return on Advertising
(55:14) that means for every one dollar you put in you get four dollars back and then you use the referral Playbook and get every customer to refer one more customer so you go from four to one to eight to one but in reality those four would then get you another four into infinity and this is how you make crazy profits but at the end of the day to grow forever you just got to get more customers to refer than exit that's it and once you do that you can grow as big as you want in fact this referral Playbook generated 300 000 a week in sales for us to gym
(55:42) launch the best part is we found out by accident when my ads got shut off for two weeks and we still kept making sales but after realizing it happened by accident we reverse engineered what we had done and started doing it on purpose I spent the next six months interviewing all the best businesses in our Network and I took pages of notes then re-categorized them by topic and then look for common factors that they all had and there were six and then we started implementing them in our locations and like clockwork we could triple how many people stayed and how
(56:11) many people they sent and here's what the referral Playbook will show you how to do step one figure out your referral percentage to churn percentage all right that is the ratio that we will optimize for for the rest of this step two get more people to refer without asking them all right this is the result of those findings all right so I'll show you how to pick better customers how to set better expectations how to get more people better results how to get them faster results with just two aspects one is actually getting faster results the other is increasing their perception of speed you can do both
(56:43) how to keep making your stuff better and how to tell them what to buy next because if they don't know what to buy next you can be darn sure they're not going to do it in step three get more people to refer by asking well all right and so what I'm going to give you is my seven all-time best referral programs that you can Implement to get leads tomorrow all right you can just copy and paste them in fact Vadim copy and pasted one of my referral programs into his business and got 105 people and added 28 000 to his annual revenue for free because that's
(57:12) the beautiful thing about referrals it costs nothing while donating 2500 to Toys for Tots and serving his community which is my favorite way to do business do good and make good money hand in hand and this stuff works when you're starting out or when you're scaled all the way up and rather than ask you through the hundreds of interviews and Consulting process I just want to give you the answers to the test all right you could literally do nothing else I showed you today run one of my seven referral
(57:36) programs in this Playbook and get customers tomorrow all right which on its own would cover the investment from this entire program which would be life-changing for you but I value today only a fraction of my investment of time money at 997 dollars so here's what you get you get lead magnet Mastery you get the first five clients framework you get multimedia content method you get the cold Outreach Playbook you get the paid ads Playbook you get the referral Playbook total value 8282 now if you're the type of person who
(58:00) loves building relationships and you believe in expanding the size of the pie and finding win-win scenarios and want to create long-term allies on your entrepreneurial Journey then you're going to love this the affiliate Playbook so what's an affiliate an affiliate is a lead getter they are an independent business that tells Their audience to buy your stuff Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside but are much different under the hood first they have their own businesses and do their own advertising second they agree to offer your stuff to get to their engaged leads
(58:32) in exchange for money free stuff or both and so here's how Affiliates make you more money so consider these two scenarios scenario one you sell 10 customers per month worth ten thousand dollars each your business grows to a hundred thousand dollars per month now mind you you can change the zeros all right it doesn't really matter but the concept Remains the Same all right assuming no other advertising or business plateaus in 12 months you've made 1.2 million dollars your Leverage is low again this could be twelve hundred dollars twelve
(58:59) thousand dollars 1.2 million or 120 million it doesn't matter but the leverage of how you built it Still Remains low because you're the one getting customers now let's look at scenario two you sell 10 Affiliates per month not customers you sell 10 Affiliates per month and then each affiliate sells you one new customer per month for you and so every month you add another hundred thousand dollars of Revenue on top of last month so it looks like this the first month you get 10 Affiliates to send you 10 customers the next month you get another 10
(59:30) Affiliates who send you another 10 customers for a total of 20 new customers the next month another 10 Affiliates for children of 30 sending you 30 customers and Affiliates keep sending you customers and you keep growing in 12 months you've made 7.
(59:49) 8 million dollars and it continues thereafter the key point is that in both scenarios you sell 10 humans per month it's either you sell 10 customers per month or you sell 10 Affiliates per month you guys see the difference but only scenario two keeps growing month after month after month with the same work same work more money leverage High isn't scenario two better that's a lot more money for the same work and the best part is it's free you just attach your offer to their offer and let them advertise for you so for example if I owned a massage studio I might tell six corporations I'll give all new employees a free massage right free massage for every employee
(1:00:25) now whenever they hire someone new they send their employees to me AKA free leads to me every month and that's all it is anyone can do this and it's 100 legal so the affiliate Playbook will show you how to step one find your ideal Affiliates step two make them a win-win offer which is really key if you noted for this event the win-win is that the top Affiliates I would provide value to Their audience rather than saying hey top Affiliates get a Lamborghini which would not add value to Their audience right you can structure way that everyone wins which is one of my
(1:00:54) favorite ways to use Affiliates step three train them to sell your stuff because if they don't know how to sell your stuff they're going to say the wrong thing and people have bad expectations step four figure out what to pay them we paid tens of thousands of dollars at gym launch for a consultant to come in who only sets up affiliate payment compensation programs and I'm going to give you everything they gave me all they do it's all yours step five get them advertising because you got them to this point now they got to get you leads in Step six once they
(1:01:21) get you leads you want to keep them getting you leads so you keep them advertising in fact these were the actual sales numbers from the First full month of sales from our supplement company Prestige Labs so you can see there 429 000 that was week one 383 411 404 000 with zero paid ads using 100 affiliates so if you're trying to add it up it was 1.
(1:01:46) 7 million dollars per month and the best part was they took care of the advertising and the selling for us we just delivered the products now this was the second time I tried to launch Affiliates the first time was a complete disaster and it took me two years before I launched again and this time I documented all the mistakes that I'd made the first time and since then I've done 75 million dollars in sales from Affiliates between our portfolio companies and as a reminder that this works today this is the exact process I followed to get 23 722 Affiliates who promoted this event so you could skip every other section and only get one business to send you
(1:02:16) leads using this Playbook and cover the entire investment for this system for good which would transform your entire business and maybe your life but I value today only a fraction of my investment time money at one thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars so you'll get lead magnet Mastery which you can immediately use to get way more people to want your stuff that will eventually buy you'll have the first five client framework so that anyone can launch the new business quit the job launch the new product in whatever division you're in and get the first customers on board you'll have the most immediate content
(1:02:43) Playbook which we have never shown publicly everyone tries to look from the outside in to figure out what we do and how we do it this will show you step by step how we've scaled the cold Outreach Playbook which literally saved gem launch at its hardest time and was able to scale a gym company during covid because that's how bulletproof it is once you get it right the paid ads Playbook which has been the source of my material wealth and is the fastest way to get new customers even if you have no reputation
(1:03:09) the referral Playbook which is actually the Silicon Valley hack at getting unlimited free customers by taking your customers to get you more customers and then the affiliate Playbook which is where you lock arms with other businesses you find partners and you all charge forward together and you get to benefit from their advertising total value ten two seven nine so no matter which Playbook you choose to use you now have all the Infinity Stones and if you wanted to use more than one which I recommend you might be wondering how do I know which Playbook to use in
(1:03:39) what order which is why I outlined the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap think of it as The Gauntlet that holds all the stones it breaks down the seven levels of scaling leads in advertising which will show you exactly what Playbook to use for your business right now and rather than go into detail in each level why don't I just show you what it looks like when you have them all so instead of wiping out the universe when you snap your fingers you'll turn them all into leads and so this is what it looks like at
(1:04:09) scale your media team scales tons of free content and all media Types on many platforms you regularly make offers to your warm audience to get more customers or Affiliates your audience Goodwill makes anything you launch immediately profitable you have teams running and scaling profitable paid ads across multiple platforms your code Outreach teams get you more customers on autopilot you have affiliate managers launching and integrating all new Affiliates you have recruiters and recruiting agencies bringing in more lead Getters your product is so good that a third of your customers bringing more customers your
(1:04:38) executive team drives all this growth without you and you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle and that last part is the most important you have more engaged leads than you can possibly handle in other words a 100 million dollar leads machine so remember I said earlier a man with an experience is never a immersive man with an opinion the reason I know this is what it looks like is because I lived it we cross 10 million a month using the exact roadmap that I just outlined my books and courses are my living
(1:05:07) documentation of that Journey mind you took me a while to figure this stuff out I was stuck for three years between 30 and 40 million a year until a mentor of mine told me why I was stuck then within two years we crossed 10 million a month so for me this road map has cost me a decade and every mistake that I've made and if you ignored everything else and simply got Clarity on what you should be doing to grow it would cover the cost of the entire investment which why I think it's fair to valued at one thousand seven hundred ninety seven dollars all right so you're
(1:05:36) gonna get lead magnet Mastery you're gonna get the first five plan framework you'll get the most immediate content method to build the brands you want you can get the cold Outreach Playbook so that you can get leads in any condition in any environment you're going to get the paid ads Playbook that you can crank with zero reputation to get more customers you're gonna have the referral Playbook that can give you the virality in the business you want that can scale with the highest margins and you're going to get the affiliate Playbook which allow you to partner with other
(1:06:00) businesses to get you more leads and the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap from someone who's actually been there total value 12.76. this is all the stuff you're going to get listen these systems are more valuable than the masterminds that sell for twenty five thousand fifty thousand even a hundred thousand dollars from goobers who've never even done it and it will give you hilariously more value than a hundred thousand dollar four-year degree and you've seen this has produced a hundred million
(1:06:30) dollars in sales for me and my companies and a 46.2 million dollar exit in hard cost alone this has cost me over 10 million dollars to figure out what actually works and if you were to pay me hourly to teach you one-on-one based on my hourly earnings or last five years it would cost you two million dollars so if I were to price this and what it's truly worth I wouldn't have any issue asking you to invest 100 Grand to get the entire system and before I tell you the price let me ask you a question how much is double your lead flow worth an extra ten thousand a year
(1:06:59) an extra fifty thousand a year an extra hundred thousand a year extra million dollars a year hold that number in your head really think about it what is that worth if you knew beyond a shot of a doubt that it would happen wouldn't be worth at least that much because after 100 million dollar offers Nick tripled his cleaning business from 87 class to 252 clients and Bill took his Pizzeria from 13 000 a week to twenty thousand week adding 300 350 000 per year in sales and Aaron went from shrugging to make his online business work to netting 1.9 million in eight months
(1:07:31) and natural went from 100 000 a year in a small Market to 500 000 a year in a bigger Market an extra 400 000 a year and Dylan was able to not 2x 3x but 5x is business you can see in the bottom he said you've made me more money than I can ever hope to return thanks for all you do Bobby added 1.
(1:07:48) 6 million to his income in eight months for all these guys it would have been worth it at any price and that's why 100 Elite system is a bargain at 1276 but consider this if all this did was give you enough money to quit your job like it did for me or allow you to start your first business like you did for me or save your business from closing like it did for me or if all this it was Triple your leads like I did for Xavier or if all this did was in 24 months because that's how long I've been doing this give you the skills to launch an event like this using only what's inside the system
(1:08:18) wouldn't it be worth it I think so too which is why it's an even bigger bargain and not 12076 but four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars because if every week all it does is get you one more customer one more referral one more affiliate it'll pay for itself in months or even weeks I mean Ivan didn't even have to finish my last last book to jump start his business all right and the best part is you only invest once but you get to keep making money using the skills for the rest of your life which is why skills are the best investment look if I put my last thousand dollars into the S P 500 in
(1:08:54) 2017 which returns nine percent a year today I'd only have twenty one hundred and eighty three dollars but instead I invested my last thousand dollars in the SME 500 skills and turned a thousand dollars into what we have now so which would you rather have four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars or your dream right me too which is why this may be the best offer I've ever given at not twelve thousand not four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars but two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars but because I want each and every one of you to 2x 5x 10x your lead flow and your
(1:09:32) business over the next 12 months and I know how life-changing this system has been for me and my family and I want this to be affordable for everyone but still an investment I'm not going to ask for 1276 even though be totally reasonable and a bargain I'm not going to ask for 4 997 I'm not even gonna ask for two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm gonna give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of a single payment of it's free laughs I love you guys [Laughter]
(1:10:19) gotcha yes it's 100 free all right it's all yours that's my way of saying thank you for being a part of this movement you guys stoked you guys feeling it you guys feeling it you're like what did he forget oh wait there's more hahaha [Laughter] I see some shell-shock faces but wait there's more so on top of that you'll also get the 100 million leads audiobook free everyone's like Alex makes his money selling audiobooks it's free so you get both the 100 million dollar lead system and 100 million leads audiobook 100 free
(1:11:28) you'll find the system right next to the 100 million offers course on my site you won't have to opt in it's freely available for everyone in the public and you'll get the audiobook it'll be on my podcast after we're done today all right so both will be live immediately after we're done today all right now oh no we're not we're just believe it or not we're just getting going so now at the very beginning I said I was going to help two types of people today so I said number one for people who need to put their oxygen mask on and take
(1:11:59) care of themselves and their family I promise you I will help you get closer to that today for free period so you're going to want to wait until the end because I'm going to deliver on that big time and so do you feel like I kept my promise to group one great so now for everybody else this is for you for those of you who are in a position to help me pay it forward I'm going to show you how it's in your self-interest to help everyone else once you see that you'll see you can accomplish both our missions together
(1:12:35) so here's the deal I wrote 19 drafts of 100 million dollar leads I actually found some of my older ones so my very first version was lead generation and monetization structures right wasn't a very good name I found my V10 one hanging around and what you guys will get is v19 and I had four four full rewrites it took me six hours a day for nearly two years to bring this to you guys in the cleanest simplest most digestible way and every time I didn't want to rewrite something to make it a little bit clearer my editor would yell at me you'd be like there's a 17 year old kid who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of a situation you owe
(1:13:17) it to him and that's what got me through this you guys I enjoy writing but it's a hard process but I stand here now confident that this is my best work today so it's with a lot of Pride that I present to you the 100 million leads collector's edition hardback but before I tell you where you can grab your copy who here's life is made better by the content the courses and the books put a money bag in the chat you can wave too you can you can do both if you feel like if you're feeling extra peppy today you guys glad you showed up you guys glad you showed up
